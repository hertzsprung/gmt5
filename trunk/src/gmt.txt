.SH NAME
gmt \- The Generic Mapping Tools data processing and display software package
.SH INTRODUCTION
\fBGMT\fP is a collection of public-domain Unix tools that allows you to manipulate x,y
and x,y,z data sets (filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.)
and produce \fIPostScript\fP illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots, via
contour maps, to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-d perspective
views in black/white or 24bit color.  Linear, log10, and power scaling is supported in
addition to 25 common map projections.  The processing and display routines within GMT
are completely general and will handle any (x,y) or (x,y,z) data as input.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGMT\fP is also a wrapper script that can start any of the programs:
.br
.sp
\fBGMT\fP module module-options
.br
.sp
where module is the name of a GMT program and the options are those that pertain to
that particular program.
