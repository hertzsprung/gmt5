**-bi**\ [*ncols*][*type*]
    Select binary input. Append one or more comma-separated combinations
    of *ncols*\ *type*, where *ncols* is the actual number of data
    columns and *type* must be one of **c** (int8\_t, aka char), **u**
    (uint8\_t, aka unsigned char), **h** (int16\_t, 2-byte signed int),
    **H** (uint16\_t, 2-byte unsigned int), **i** (int32\_t, 4-byte
    signed int), **I** (uint32\_t, 4-byte unsigned int), **l**
    (int64\_t, 8-byte signed int), **L** (uint64\_t, 8-byte unsigned
    int), **f** (4-byte single-precision float), and **d** (8-byte
    double-precision float). In addition, use **x** to skip *ncols*
    bytes anywhere in the record. Append **w** to any item to force
    byte-swapping. Alternatively, append **+L**\ \|\ **B** to indicate
    that the entire data file should be read as little- or big-endian,
    respectively. The total number of *ncols* may exceed the columns
    actually needed by the program. If no *ncols* is specified we assume
    that *type* applies to all columns and that *ncols* is implied by
    the expectation of the program. If the input file is netCDF, no
    **-b** is needed; simply append **?**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...*
    to the filename to specify the variables to be read.
