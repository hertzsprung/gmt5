Select grid interpolation mode by adding \fBb\fP for B-spline smoothing,
\fBc\fP for bicubic interpolation, \fBl\fP for bilinear interpolation, or
\fBn\fP for nearest-neighbor value (for example to plot categorical data).
Optionally, append BD(+a) to switch off antialiasing (where supported).
Add append BD(+b)IT(BC) to change the boundary conditions used, giving
BD(+bg) for geographic boundary conditions or a combination of BD(x)
and BD(y) for periodic boundary conditions in the IT(x) and IT(y) direction.
Add append BD(+t)IT(threshold) to control how close to nodes with NaNs the interpolation will go.
A IT(threshold) of 1.0 requires all (4 or 16) nodes involved in interpolation
to be non-NaN. 0.5 will interpolate about half way from a non-NaN value; 0.1 will go about 90% of the way, etc.
[Default is bicubic interpolation with antialiasing and a threshold of 0.5, using
geographic  (if grid is known to be geographic) or natural boundary conditions].
