.TP
IT(NGDC-ids)
Can be one or more of five kinds of specifiers:
.br
1) 8-character NGDC IDs, e.g., 01010083, JA010010etc., etc.
.br
2) 2-character <agency> codes which will return all cruises from each agency.
.br
3) 4-character <agency><vessel> codes, which will return all cruises from those vessels.
.br
4) =<list>, where <list> is a table with NGDC IDs, one per line.
.br
5) If nothing is specified we return all cruises in the data base.
.br
(See mgd77info OPT(L) for agency and vessel codes).
The ".mgd77" or ".nc" extensions will automatically be appended, if needed (use OPT(I)
to ignore certain file types).  Cruise files will be looked for first in the current directory
and second in all directories listed in BD($MGD77_HOME)/mgd77_paths.txt [If BD($MGD77_HOME)
is not set it will default to BD($GMT_SHAREDIR)/mgd77].
