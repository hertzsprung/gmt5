In case of perspective view (OPT(p)), a z-range (IT(zmin), IT(zmax)) can be appended to indicate
the third dimension. This needs to be done only when using the OPT(Jz) option, not when using
only the OPT(p) option. In the latter case a perspective view of the plane is plotted, with
no third dimension.
