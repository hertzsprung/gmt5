\fItracks\fP
Can be one or more binary or ASCII data files. To give a list of names,
use `cat tracks.lis`.  If the names are missing the suffix we will
append the suffix that goes with this \fITAG\fP.  Track files will be looked
for first in the current directory and second in all directories listed in
\fB$X2SYS_HOME\fP/\fITAG\fP_paths.txt (if it exists). [If \fB$X2SYS_HOME\fP
is not set it will default to \fB$GMTHOME\fP/share/x2sys].
