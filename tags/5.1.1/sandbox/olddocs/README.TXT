2013-June-24 pwessel:

Sometime during Spring 2013 we stopped updating the old nroff *.txt man page sources
and the old *.tex Latex sources, and only added new features to the RST documentation.
To avoid confusion we moved all those obsolete source files to sandbox/olddocs just
for reference.  At some point we will purge them from the repository.
