<center><h2>GMT 5 Parallelization Case Studies</h2>
	<h3>Paul Wessel, Dave Sandwell, Kurt Feigl</h3></center>
	
<h3>Overview</h3>
We have set up the 3 test cases discussed at our August 12, 2014 meeting
at SDSC that demonstrate GMT processing bottlenecks that SDSC might be able
to speed up using parallelization and linear algebra optimization.<P>
Test scripts and data demonstrating GMT use for these cases
are available from this <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/sdsc/gmt-sdsc.tgz"> gzipped tarball</a>.
After expanding the tarball the top-level sdsc directory contains the demonstration data sets topo.nc (a netCDF grid)
and topo.xyz (3-column lon,lat,height ascii table), with subdirectories 1, 2 and 3 corresponding to the
three cases.  The scripts in these subdirectories can be run as soon as GMT .has been installed<P>

<h3>GMT 5 SDSC branch installation</h3>
SDSC developers must use the SDSC branch of GMT 5, which can only
be installed via svn:<P>

svn checkout svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt5/branches/sdsc gmt5-sdsc<P>

Follow the "Building Instructions" on the <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu" target="blank"> GMT wiki</a> side-bar
but ignore the svn command to get source from trunk since you will be
using the sdsc branch discussed above instead.  Since the sdsc branch will change with time (as we merge in bug fixes and other issues)
you should do a "svn up" once in a while to get the latest changes.  We will try hard to avoid stepping on the code sections you
are working with in order to minimize conflicts.  Note that the cmake process checks for Open MP flags so presumably much of the
machinery for setting up the environment is built in.<P>

<h3>The three test cases</h3>
<OL>
	<LI><B>Linear Algebra [Directory 1: spline.sh].</B>
	The program greenspline.c solves the 1-, 2-, or 3-D gridding problem
	exactly by using Green's functions that correspond to the various splines
	of interest (e.g., minimum curvature, splines in tension, regularized splines)
	and geometries (Cartesian, spherical surface).  This approach to gridding is
	discussed in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2008.08.012" target="blank"> Wessel, 2009</a>
	and references therein.
	Regardless of spline, there are two key tasks that are computer-intensive:
	<UL>
		<LI>Solving the square <B>Ax</B> = <B>b</B> linear system for the weights for each Green's function.
		<LI>Evaluate solution at all output nodes.
	</UL>
	The first task is either done using a Gauss-Jordan approach which yields an exact fit, or
	we select an approximate fit by decomposing <B>A</B> via a SVD routine and then set smaller
	eigenvalues to zero.  The second tasks involves a loop over all the Green's functions for
	each output node.  A simple Open MP approach should work well for the second task, while the
	first task may require more optimized solvers, e.g., BLAS/LaPack stuff. Because the slowness of
	the solution, greenspline.c is presently not practical for larger data sets. Directory 1 contains
	a demonstration script spline.sh which explores both exact and approximate fits to a test data set
	and makes simple maps for comparison on one page (spline.pdf). Here is a link to the man page for
	greenspline as it appears in the trunk:
	<a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/latest/greenspline.html" target="blank">greenspline man page</a><P>
	<LI><B>Simple Parallel [Directory 2; filt.sh].</B>
	The program grdfilter.c performs filtering operations in the 2-D space domain. Users can choose
	among convolution filters (e.g., Gaussian, boxcar) or geospatial operators (e.g., median, mode).
	Regardless of filter, the solution is obtained by visiting all desired output nodes and for each
	node compute the result using all data notes inside the selected filter radius.  Again, a simple
	Open MP approach should work well for this case. Directory 2 contains
	a demonstration script filt.sh which shows both a convolution and geospatial filter operation and
	presents a single page plot with the two filtered solutions (filt.pdf). Here is a link to the man page for
	grdfilter as it appears in the trunk:
	<a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/latest/grdfilter.html" target="blank">grdfilter man page</a><P>
	<LI><B>Finite Difference Solver [Directory 3; surf.sh].</B>
	The program surface.c solves the Cartesian 2-D gridding problem using a continuous surface spline,
	optionally in tension.  It does this by solving a 4th order (biharmonic) equation using finite
	differences with a multigrid strategy.  It can handle enormous data sets and output grids. It would
	be nice if we were able to use more than one core to solve these equations but we don't know how.
	The details of this algorithm is discussed in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.1442837" target="blank"> Smith and Wessel, 1990</a>.
	Directory 3 contains a demonstration script surf.sh which grids the same data set twice: Once using
	the default convergence parameters and once with tighter constraints and over-relaxation of 1.4.  The
	two maps look fairly similar (surf.pdf) Here is a link to the man page for
	surface as it appears in the trunk:
	<a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/latest/surface.html" target="blank">surface man page</a>.
	One odd thing to note about surface is that we wrote this back in the late 1980s when the GMT grid format
	was Fortran-ish, i.e., a collection of columns.  Now, GMT uses scanline (C) orientation hence surface ends
	its execution with a matrix transpose. While silly, this takes only a tiny fraction of the run-time
	and would take us lots of time and testing to recode into scanline form directly.

<h3>GMT and multiple cores</h3>
GMT knows how many cores are available.  If you just type<P>
gmt<P>
it will report its splash screen and list how many cores in brackets. I.e., the first line on output for me
today on a new Mac Pro looks like this:<P>
GMT - The Generic Mapping Tools, Version 5.2.0_r13429 [64-bit] [24 cores]<P>
	From scripts one can obtain the number of cores via the --with-cores option, i.e.<P>
	n_cores=`gmt --with-cores`
<P>
The variable API->n_cores is available throughout the modules.
There is also be a command-line option  <B>-x</B><I>n_cores</I>>) that can be used by the user to tell a
parallelized GMT module how many cores to use (or use all).  You will see grdfilter.c has this option.
So when OpenMP stuff has been implemented you can run the grdfilter examples by adding -xa (for all cores).<P>
