Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.5.2.
This release mostly fixes several bugs but also adds some new
functionality, such as a math graph mode and a curved arrow
symbol in psxy[z].  Finally, we needed to make a small revision
to the netcdf GSHHS files (2.0.2) to correct a pscoast bug.
Note GSHHS 2.0.2 is required for GMT 4.5.2.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

As of this notice, all but the Japan and S Africa mirror
ftp servers are now synced up; we hope those two will follow
within 24 hours.  Alternatively, OS X users will find GMT 4.5.2
and GSHHS 2.0.2 in Fink's 'unstable' tree.

Finally, 4.5.2 is the last GMT 4 release with new features.
All development is now focused on GMT 5.  However, we expect
to issue more 4.5.? releases (to fix bugs only) until a stable
GMT 5 is announced.  We expect to release a beta version of GMT
5 later this spring.

As of this notice, all but the Japan, Vienna and S Africa mirror
ftp servers are now synced up; we hope those two will follow
within 24 hours.


Sincerely,

The GMT Team
