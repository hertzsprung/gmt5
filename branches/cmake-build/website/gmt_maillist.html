<CENTER><H2>GMT Mailing Lists</H2></CENTER>
Two electronic mailing lists are available for users to subscribe to.
<OL>
<LI><B>gmt-help@lists.hawaii.edu</B> provides a forum
for GMT users to exchange ideas and ask questions about GMT usage,
installation, portability, etc. Please use this utility rather than
sending questions directly to us;
you are much more likely to get a speedy reply.
<LI><B>gmt-group@lists.hawaii.edu</B> is a one-way street
for us to notify users when a new version has been released. No user
can post to this list.  Please subscribe to this list if you ONLY
want email when a new version is available.
</OL>

To add yourself to these mailinglist (maintained by the listserv
program), send email to <A HREF="mailto:listserv@lists.hawaii.edu">listserv@lists.hawaii.edu</A>
with a one-line message. E.g., if your name is John Smith then send

<P><B>subscribe gmt-help John Smith</B>

<P>Listserv automatically obtains your email address.  To unsubscribe, send
<P><B>signoff gmt-help</B>
<P>
instead.  The same procedure is used for <B>gmt-group</B>.
<P>
To browse previously posted messages to gmt-help, please visit the official
<A HREF="https://listserv.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=GMT-HELP">GMT Mailing List Archive</A>.
gmt-help is also available as a read-only netnews group via NNTP as
gis.gmtlist at server <A HREF="news://news2.sinica.edu.tw">news2.sinica.edu.tw</A>.

<P>Occasionally, a frustrated new GMT user will convince him/herself
that their work is of paramount importance and hence they feel justified in digging up our
phone numbers and calling us directly to get personal attention to their vexing
problem. Please don't even <B>think</B> about doing this unless you are
prepared to pay our standard consulting fee of USD 300 per hour and endure
insults that would make hardened C-programmers blush...
