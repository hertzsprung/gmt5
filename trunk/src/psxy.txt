.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpsxy\fP reads (\fIx\fP,\fIy\fP) pairs from \fIfiles\fP [or standard input] and
generates \fIPostScript\fP code that will plot lines, polygons, or symbols at those locations on a map.
If a symbol is selected and no symbol size given, then \fBpsxy\fP will interpret the third column of the
input data as symbol size.  Symbols whose \fIsize\fP is <= 0 are skipped.
If no symbols are specified then the symbol code (see OPT(S) below)
must be present as last column in the input.  Multiple segment files may be plotted using the OPT(m) option.
If OPT(S) is not used, a line connecting the data points will be drawn instead.
To explicitly close polygons, use OPT(L).  Select a fill with OPT(G).
If OPT(G) is set, OPT(W) will control whether the polygon outline is drawn or not.
If a symbol is selected, OPT(G) and OPT(W) determines the fill and outline/no outline, respectively.
The \fIPostScript\fP code is written to standard output.
.TP
\fIfiles\fP
List one or more file-names. If no files are given, \fBpsxy\fP will read standard input.
Use OPT(T) to ignore all input files, including standard input (see below).
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
#include "explain_-R.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(A)
By default line segments are drawn as great circle arcs. To draw them as straight lines,
use the OPT(A) flag. Alternatively, add \fBm\fP to draw the line by first following a meridian,
then a parallel. Or append \fBp\fP to start following a parallel, then a meridian.
(This can be practical to draw a lines along parallels, for example).
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
OPT(C)
Give a color palette file.  If OPT(S) is set, let symbol fill color be determined by the
z-value in the third column.  Additional fields are shifted over by one column
(optional size would be 4th rather than 3rd field, etc.).
If OPT(S) is not set, then \fBpsxy\fP expects the user to supply a multisegment line or polygon file
(requires OPT(m)) where each segment header contains a OPT(Z)\fIval\fP string.  The \fIval\fP
will control the color of the line or polygon (if OPT(L) is set) via the cpt file.
.TP
OPT(D)
Offset the plot symbol or line locations by the given amounts \fIdx/dy\fP [Default is no offset].
If \fIdy\fP is not given it is set equal to \fIdx\fP.
.TP
OPT(E)
Draw error bars.  Append \fBx\fP and/or \fBy\fP to indicate which bars you want to draw (Default is both x and y).  The x and/or
y errors must be stored in the columns after the (x,y) pair [or (x,y,size) triplet].  The
\fIcap\fP parameter indicates the length of the end-cap on the error bars [CAP_SI (or CAP_US)].  Pen
attributes for error bars may also be set (see SPECIFYING PENS below) [Defaults: width = 1, color = black, texture = solid].
A leading \fB+\fP will use the lookup color (via OPT(C)) for both symbol fill and error pen color, while a leading
\fB-\fP will set error pen color and turn off symbol fill.
If upper case \fBX\fP and/or \fBY\fP is used we will instead draw "box-and-whisker" (or "stem-and-leaf") symbols.  The x (or y)
coordinate is then taken as the median value, and 4 more columns are expected to contain the minimum (0% quantile), the 25%
quantile, the 75% quantile, and the maximum (100% quantile) values.  The 25-75% box may be filled by using OPT(G).
If \fBn\fP is appended to \fBX\fP (or \fBY\fP) we draw a notched "box-and-whisker" symbol where the notch width reflects
the uncertainty in the median.  Then a 5th extra data column is expected to contain the number of points in the distribution.
.TP
OPT(G)
Select color or pattern for filling of symbols or polygons [Default is no fill].
(See SPECIFYING FILL below).
.br
Note when OPT(m) is chosen, \fBpsxy\fP will search for OPT(G) and OPT(W)
strings in all the subheaders and let any values thus found over-ride the command line settings
(see OPT(m) below).
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
OPT(I)
Use the supplied \fIintens\fP value (nominally in the -1 to + 1 range) to modulate the fill color by simulating illumination [none].
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
OPT(L)
Force closed polygons: connect the endpoints of the line-segment(s) and draw polygons.
Also, in concert with OPT(C), OPT(m), and OPT(Z) settings in the headers will use the implied
color for polygon fill [Default is polygon pen color].
.TP
OPT(N)
Do NOT skip symbols that fall outside map border [Default plots points inside border only].
The option does not apply to lines and polygons which are always clipped to the map region.
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
OPT(S)
Plot symbols.  If present, \fIsize\fP is symbol size in the unit set in \.gmtdefaults4
(unless \fBc\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBm\fP, or \fBp\fP is appended).
If the symbol code (see below) is not given it will be read from the last column in the input data;
this cannot be used in conjunction with OPT(b).  Optionally, append
\fBc\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBm\fP, \fBp\fP to indicate that the size information in the
input data is in units of cm, inch, meter, or point, respectively [Default is \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP].
Note: if you give both size and symbol via the input file you must use \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP to
indicate the units used for the symbol size.
.br
The uppercase symbols \fBA\fP, \fBC\fP, \fBD\fP, \fBG\fP, \fBH\fP, \fBI\fP, \fBN\fP, \fBS\fP, \fBT\fP
are normalized to have the same area as a circle with diameter \fIsize\fP,
while the size of the corresponding lowercase symbols refers to the diameter of a circumscribed circle.
Choose between these symbol codes:
.TP
OPT(S-)
x-dash (-).  \fIsize\fP is the length of a short horizontal line segment.
.TP
OPT(S+)
plus (+).  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sa)
st\fBa\fPr.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sb)
Vertical \fBb\fPar extending from \fIbase\fP to y.  \fIsize\fP is bar width. Append \fBu\fP
if \fIsize\fP is in x-units [Default is plot-distance units]. By default,
\fIbase\fP = ymin.  Append \fBb\fP\fIbase\fP to change this value.
.TP
OPT(SB)
Horizontal \fBb\fPar extending from \fIbase\fP to x.  \fIsize\fP is bar width. Append \fBu\fP
if \fIsize\fP is in y-units [Default is plot-distance units]. By default,
\fIbase\fP = xmin.  Append \fBb\fP\fIbase\fP to change this value.
.TP
OPT(Sc)
\fBc\fPircle.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circle.
.TP
OPT(Sd)
\fBd\fPiamond.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Se)
\fBe\fPllipse.  Direction (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), major_axis, and minor_axis must
be found in columns 3, 4, and 5.
.TP
OPT(SE)
Same as OPT(Se), except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (OPT(Se) leaves the directions
unchanged.)  Furthermore, the axes lengths must be given in km instead of plot-distance units.  An exception occurs for
a linear projection in which we assume the ellipse axes are given in the same units as OPT(R).
.TP
OPT(Sf)
\fBf\fPront.  OPT(Sf)\fIgap/size\fP[\fIdir\fP][\fItype\fP][:\fIoffset\fP].  Supply distance gap between symbols and symbol size.
If \fIgap\fP is negative, it is interpreted to mean the number of symbols along the front instead.  Append \fIdir\fP to plot symbols
on the \fBl\fPeft or \fBr\fPight side of the front [Default is centered].  Append \fItype\fP to specify which symbol
to plot: \fBb\fPox, \fBc\fPircle, \fBf\fPault, \fBs\fPlip, or \fBt\fPriangle.  [Default is fault].
Slip means left-lateral or right-lateral strike-slip arrows (centered is not an option).  Append :\fIoffset\fP to offset
the first symbol from the beginning of the front by that amount [Default is 0].
.TP
OPT(Sg)
octa\fBg\fPon.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sh)
\fBh\fPexagon.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Si)
\fBi\fPnverted triangle.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sj)
Rotated rectangle.  Direction (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), x-dimension, and y-dimension must be found in columns 3, 4, and 5.
.TP
OPT(SJ)
Same as OPT(Sj), except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (OPT(Sj) leaves the directions
unchanged.)  Furthermore, the dimensions must be given in km instead of plot-distance units.  An exception occurs for
a linear projection in which we assume the dimensions are given in the same units as OPT(R).
.TP
OPT(Sk)
\fBk\fPustom symbol.  Append <name>/\fIsize\fP, and we will look for a definition file called
<name>.def in (1) the current directory or (2) in ~/.gmt or (3) in \fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/custom.  The symbol as defined
in that file is of size 1.0 by default; the appended \fIsize\fP will scale symbol accordingly.
Users may add their own custom *.def files; see CUSTOM SYMBOLS below.
.TP
OPT(Sl)
\fBl\fPetter or text string (less than 64 characters).  Give size, and append /\fIstring\fP after the size.
Note that the size is only approximate; no individual scaling
is done for different characters.  Remember to escape special characters like *.  Optionally, you may append %\fIfont\fP
to select a particular font [Default is \fBANNOT_FONT_PRIMARY\fP].
.TP
OPT(Sm)
\fBm\fPath angle arc, optionally with one or two arrow heads.  The \fIsize\fP is the radius of the arc.
Start and stop directions (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal) for arc
must be found in columns 3 and 4.  Use OPT(Smf) to add arrow head at first angle, OPT(Sml) for arrow head at last angle, and OPT(Smb) for both
[Default is no arrow heads].
.TP
OPT(Sn)
pe\fBn\fPtagon.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sp)
\fBp\fPoint.  No size needs to be specified (1 pixel is used).
.TP
OPT(Sq)
\fBq\fPuoted line, i.e., lines with annotations such as contours.
Append [\fBd\fP|\fBD\fP|\fBf\fP|\fBl\fP|\fBL\fP|\fBn\fP|\fBx\fP|\fBX\fP]\fIinfo\fP[:\fIlabelinfo\fP].
#include "explain_contlabel.txt"
.sp
.RS
The optional \fIlabelinfo\fP controls the specifics of the label formatting and consists of a concatenated string
made up of any of the following control arguments:
.RE
#include "explain_labelinfo.txt"
.TP
OPT(Sr)
\fBr\fPectangle.  No size needs to be specified, but the x- and y-dimensions must be found in columns
3 and 4.
.TP
OPT(Ss)
\fBs\fPquare.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(St)
\fBt\fPriangle.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sv)
\fBv\fPector.  Direction (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal) and length must be found in columns 3 and 4.
\fIsize\fP, if present, will be interpreted as \fIarrowwidth/headlength/headwidth\fP
[Default unit is PARAMS_SI (or PARAMS_US)].
By default arrow attributes remains invariant to the length
of the arrow.  To have the size of the vector scale down with decreasing size,
append \fBn\fP\fInorm\fP, where vectors shorter than \fInorm\fP will have their
attributes scaled by length/\fInorm\fP.
To center vector on balance point, use OPT(Svb); to align point with the vector head,
use OPT(Svh); to align point with the vector tail, use OPT(Svt) [Default].
To give the head point's coordinates\"'
instead of direction and length, use OPT(Svs).  Upper case \fBB, H, T, S\fP will draw a double-headed vector [Default is single head].
.TP
OPT(SV)
Same as OPT(Sv), except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (OPT(Sv) leaves the directions
unchanged.)
.TP
OPT(Sw)
pie \fBw\fPedge.  Start and stop directions (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal) for pie slice
must be found in columns 3 and 4.
.TP
OPT(SW)
Same as OPT(Sw), except azimuths (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of the two directions.  The azimuths will
be mapped into angles based on the chosen map projection (OPT(Sw) leaves the directions unchanged.)
.TP
OPT(Sx)
cross (x).  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sy)
y-dash (|).  \fIsize\fP is the length of a short vertical line segment.
.TP
OPT(T)
Ignore all input files, including standard input. This is the same as specifying /dev/null (or NUL for
Windows users) as input file. Use this to activate only the options that are not related to plotting
of lines or symbols, such as \fBpsxy\fP OPT(R) OPT(J) OPT(O) OPT(T) to terminate a sequence of
\fBGMT\fP plotting commands without producing any plotting output.
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)
Set pen attributes for lines or the outline of symbols [Defaults: width = 1, color = black, texture = solid].
A leading \fB+\fP will use the lookup color (via OPT(C)) for both symbol fill and outline pen color, while a leading
\fB-\fP will set outline pen color and turn off symbol fill.
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
#include "explain_-XY.txt"
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is the required number of columns given the chosen settings].
#include "explain_-c.txt"
#include "explain_-f.txt"
#include "explain_-g.txt"
The OPT(g) option is ignored if OPT(S) is set.
.TP
OPT(m)
Multiple segment file.  Segments are separated by a record whose first character is \fIflag\fP
[Default is '>']. On these segment header records one or more of the following options can be added:
.br
OPT(G)\fIfill\fP Use the new \fIfill\fP and turn filling on
.br
OPT(G-) Turn filling off
.br
OPT(G+) Revert to default fill (none if not set on command line)
.br
OPT(W)\fIpen\fP Use the new \fIpen\fP and turn outline on
.br
OPT(W-) Turn outline off
.br
OPT(W+) Revert to default pen (none if not set on command line)
.br
OPT(Z)\fIzval\fP Obtain fill via cpt lookup using z-value \fIzval\fP
.br
OPT(ZNaN) Get the NaN color from the cpt file
#include "explain_pen.txt"
#include "explain_fill.txt"
#include "explain_color.txt"

.SH CUSTOM SYMBOLS
\fBpsxy\fP and \fBpsxyz\fP allows users to define and plot their own custom symbols.
This is done by encoding the symbol using a simple plotting code described below.  Put
all the plotting codes for your new symbol in a file whose extension must be .def; you may then address
the symbol without giving the extension (e.g., the symbol file tsunami.def is used by specifying OPT(Sk)\fItsunami/size\fP.
The definition file can contain any number of plot code records, as well as blank lines and comment lines (starting with #).
\fBpsxy\fP and \fBpsxyz\fP will look for the definition files in (1) the current directory, (2) the ~/.gmt
directory, and (3) the \fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/custom directory, in that order.
Freeform polygons (made up of straight line segments and arcs of circles) can be designed - these polygons can be
painted and filled with a pattern.  Other standard geometric symbols can also be used. Generate freeform polygons
by starting with an anchor point (append [ OPT(W)\fIpen\fP ] and [ OPT(G)\fIfill\fP ]
to indicate pen and fill attributes):
.br
	\fIx0	y0\fP	\fBM\fP
.br
and draw a straight line from the current point to the next point with
.br
	\fIx	y\fP	\fBD\fP
.br
or add an arc by using
.br
	\fIxc	yc	r	dir1	dir2\fP	\fBA\fP
.br
When a record other than the \fBD\fP or \fBA\fP is encountered, the polygon is closed and considered complete.
The optional pen and fill setting hardwires particular values for this feature.  If not present the polygon's\"'
characteristics are determined by the command line settings for pen and fill.  To deactivate fill or outline
for any given polygon, give OPT(G\-) or OPT(W\-).  To add other geometric shapes
to your custom symbol, add any number of the following plot code records (each accepts the optional
[ OPT(W)\fIpen\fP ] and [ OPT(G)\fIfill\fP ] at the end):
.br
.sp

.br
x-dash:	\fIx	y	size\fP	\fB-\fP
.br
y-dash:	\fIx	y	size\fP	\fBy\fP
.br
.sp
When designing your symbol, the \fIx, y\fP and other dimensions are relative to a symbol of size 1, and all the
dimensions will be scaled by the actual symbol size chosen at run-time.  To design a symbol, make a grid paper
with \fBpsbasemap \-R\fP-0.5/0.5/-0.5/0.5 OPT(JX)4\fBi\fP OPT(Ba)0.1\gBg\gP0.05 OPT(P) > grid.ps and
draw your symbol, centering it on (0,0).  For examples of symbols, see the set supplied with \fBGMT\fP in
\fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/custom.
.SH BUGS
The OPT(N) option does not adjust the BoundingBox information so you may
have to post-process the \fIPostScript\fP output with \fBps2raster -A\fP to obtain
the correct BoundingBox.
.br
\fBpsxy\fP cannot handle filling of polygons that contain the south or north pole.  For such a polygon,
make a copy and split it into two and make each explicitly contain the polar point.  The two polygons
will combine to give the desired effect when filled; to draw outline use the original polygon.
