Example 16.  There are several ways to interpolate (x,y,z) data
in GMT.  The simplest method is triangulation, using linear triangular
facets as building-blocks.  Gridding with minimum curvature splines is
also a popular option; some of the ringing can be reduced by applying
tension.  One could also use triangulation as a starting method and
modify it later with filtering.
