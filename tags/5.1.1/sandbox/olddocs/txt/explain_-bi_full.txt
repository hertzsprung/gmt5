GMT_bi_OPT
Select binary input.  Append one or more comma-separated combinations of
IT(ncols)IT(type), where IT(ncols) is the actual number of data columns
and IT(type) must be one of BD(c) (int8_t, aka char), BD(u) (uint8_t,
aka unsigned char), BD(h) (int16_t, 2-byte signed int), BD(H) (uint16_t,
2-byte unsigned int), BD(i) (int32_t, 4-byte signed int), BD(I)
(uint32_t, 4-byte unsigned int), BD(l) (int64_t, 8-byte signed int),
BD(L) (uint64_t, 8-byte unsigned int), BD(f) (4-byte single-precision
float), and BD(d) (8-byte double-precision float).  In addition, use
BD(x) to skip IT(ncols) bytes anywhere in the record. Append BD(w) to any
item to force byte-swapping.  Alternatively, append BD(+L)|BD(B) to
indicate that the entire data file should be read as little- or
big-endian, respectively. The total number of IT(ncols) may exceed the
columns actually needed by the program.  If no IT(ncols) is specified we
assume that IT(type) applies to all columns and that IT(ncols) is
implied by the expectation of the program. If the input file is netCDF,
no OPT(b) is needed; simply append IT(var1)BD(/)IT(var2)BD(/)IT(...) to
the filename to specify the variables to be read.
