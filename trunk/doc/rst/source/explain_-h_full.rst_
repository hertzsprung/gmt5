**-h**\ [**i**\ \|\ **o**][*n*\ ]
    Input file(s) has header record(s). If used, the default number of
    header records is **IO\_N\_HEADER\_RECS** [1]. Use **-hi** if only
    input data should have header records [Default will write out header
    records if the input data have them]. Blank lines and lines starting
    with # are always skipped. Use **-ho** to force programs to write a
    header record with column names. If used with native binary data we
    interpret *n* to instead mean the number of bytes to skip on input
    or pad on output.
