.TH X2SYS_GET 1 MANDATE GMT_STRING "Generic Mapping Tools [x2sys supplement]"
.SH NAME
x2sys_get \- Get track listing from the x2sys track index databases
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(T)IT(TAG) [ OPT(C) ] [ OPT(F)IT(flags) ] [ OPT(G) ] 
[ OPT(L)[BD(+)][IT(list)] ] [ OPT(N)IT(flags) ] [ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(x2sys_get) will return the names of the track data files in the x2sys data
base for this TAG that match the given
requirements.  You may choose a specific region and optionally ask
only for tracks that meet certain data criteria.  Finally, you may
select an option to list all possible pairs that might generate crossovers.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
#include "explain_tag.txt"
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(C)
Instead of reporting the track names, just output the coordinates of the
center of each bin that has at least one track with the specified data.
.TP
OPT(F)IT(flags)
Give a comma-separated list of column names (as described in the definition
file) that should be present. [Default selects all data columns].
.TP
OPT(G)
Report data flags (Y or N) for the entire track rather than just for the
portion that is inside the region set by OPT(R) [Default].
.TP
OPT(L)[BD(+)][IT(list)]
Crossover mode.  Return a list of track pairs that should be checked for possible
crossovers.  The list is determined from the bin-index data base on the assumption
that tracks occupying the same bin are very likely to intersect.  By default we
return all possible pairs in the data base.  Append the name of a file with a
list of tracks if you want to limit the output to those pairs that involve
at least one of the track names in your list.  The output is suitable for the OPT(K)
option in BD(x2sys_cross).  By default, only external crossover pairs are listed.
Use OPT(L+) to include internal pairs in the list.
.TP
OPT(N)IT(flags)
Give a comma-separated list of column names (as described in the definition
file) that must be absent.
#include "explain_-Rgeo.txt"
For Cartesian data just give IT(xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax).  This option limits
the tracks to those that fall at least partly inside the specified domain.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_help.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To find all the tracks associated with the tag MGD77, restricted to occupy
a certain region in the south Pacific, and have at least free air anomalies
and bathymetry, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 OPT(R)180/240/-60/-30 OPT(F)faa,depth 
.br
.sp
To find all the tracks associated with the tag MGD77 that have depth but not
twt, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 OPT(F)depth OPT(N)twt
.br
.sp
To find all the pairs associated with the tag MGD77 that might intersect each
other, but only those pairs which involves tracks in your list new.lis, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 OPT(L)new.lis > xpairs.lis 
.SH NOTE
The tracks that are returned all have the requested data (OPT(F)) within the
specified region (OPT(R)).  Furthermore, the columns of Y and N for other data types
also reflect the content of the track portion within the selected region, unless
OPT(G) is set.
