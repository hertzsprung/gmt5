\chapter{Availability of \gmt\ and related code}
\label{app:D}
\index{GMT@\GMT!obtaining}
\thispagestyle{headings}

All the source code, support data, \PS\, PDF,
and HTML versions of all documentation (including \UNIX\
manual pages) can be obtained by anonymous
ftp from several mirror sites.  We also maintain a \GMT\
page on the World Wide Web (http://\GMTSITE);
See this page for installation directions 
which allow for a simplified, automatic install procedure
(for CDVD-R solutions, see \htmladdnormallink{http://www.geoware-online.com}{http://www.geoware-online.com}.)

The \GMT\ compressed tar archives requires \progname{bzip2} to expand.  If this utility
is not installed on your system, you must obtained it by your system's package manager
or install it from \footnote{http://www.bzip.org}.

The GMT archives are as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[GMT\_src.tar.bz2] Contains all \GMT\ source code needed for compilation.

\item[GMT\_share.tar.bz2] Contains support files needed at run-time (cpt files, and \PS\ patterns).

\item[GMT\_coast.tar.bz2] Contains the intermediate,
low, and crude resolutions of the GSHHS coastline database.  Required
with GMT\_src.tar and GMT\_share.tar for minimal setup needed to run \GMT.

\item[GMT\_pdf.tar.bz2] Contains PDF versions all \GMT\ documentation
(man pages, Cookbook and Technical Reference, and the tutorial).

\item[GMT\_web.tar.bz2] Contains HTML versions all \GMT\ documentation
(man pages, Cookbook and Technical Reference, and the tutorial).

\item[GMT\_tut.tar.bz2] Contains the data files used in the tutorial.

\item[GMT\_scripts.tar.bz2] Contains all the shell scripts
and support data used in the Cookbook section.

\item[GMT\_suppl.tar.bz2] Contains several programs
written by us and \GMT\ users elsewhere. (See Appendix~\ref{app:A} for more
details).

\item[GSHHS\_full.tar.bz2] Contains the optional GSHHS
full-resolution coastline database.

\item[GSHHS\_high.tar.bz2] Contains the optional GSHHS
high-resolution coastline database.

\end{description}

\index{netCDF, obtaining}

The netCDF library that makes up the backbone of the grid file
i/o operations can be obtained from  Unidata.  A compressed
tar file can be accessed (in binary mode) from the file
\filename{netcdf.tar.Z} in the anonymous FTP directory of
\underline{unidata.ucar.edu}.
The software distribution includes a \PS\ file of
the netCDF User's Guide, and there is also online documentation
from their web site.  [\htmladdnormallink{netcdfgroup@unidata.ucar.edu}{mailto:netcdfgroup@unidata.ucar.edu}
is available for discussion of the netCDF interface and
announcements about netCDF bugs, fixes, and enhancements.  To
subscribe, send a request to
\htmladdnormallink{netcdfgroup-adm@unidata.ucar.edu}{mailto:netcdfgroup-adm@unidata.ucar.edu}].

\index{GMT@\GMT!binaries for Win32}

For Windows users who do not want to compile themselves, there are three Windows installers available:

\begin{description}

\item[GMT\_basic\_install.exe] The basic install with all \GMT\ executables (including supplements),
the netCDF DLL, the crude, low, and intermediate GSHHS coastlines, the example batch scripts and data, and all
documentation in HTML format.

\item[GMT\_PDF\_install.exe] Installer for the optional \GMT\ documentation in PDF format.

\item[GSHHS\_fullhigh\_install.exe] Installer for the optional full- and high-resolution GSHHS coastlines.
