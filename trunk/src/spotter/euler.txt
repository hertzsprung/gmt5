.TP
.B \-E
Give file with rotation poles and opening angles.  This file must contain
one record for each rotation; each record must be of the following format:
.br
.sp
	\fIlon lat tstart [tstop] ccw-angle\fP [ \fIkhat a b c d e f g\fP ]
.br
.sp
where \fItstart\fP and \fItstop\fP are in Ma and \fIlon lat ccw-angle\fP are
in degrees.  The oldest stage must be listed first.  \fItstart\fP (\fItstop\fP)
is the age of the old (young) end of the stage.  If OPT(C) is set then a total
reconstruction rotation is expected and \fItstop\fP is implicitly set to 0 and
show not be in the file.  If a covariance matrix for the rotation is available
it must be specified using the eight optional terms listed in brackets.
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
