.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdimage\fP reads one 2-D gridded file and produces a gray-shaded (or colored) map by plotting
rectangles centered on each grid node and assigning them a gray-shade (or color) based on the z-value.
Alternatively, \fBgrdimage\fP reads three 2-D gridded files with the red, green, and blue components
directly (all must be in the 0-255 range). Optionally, illumination may be added by providing
a file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range.  Values outside this range will be clipped.
Such intensity files can be created from the
grid using \fBgrdgradient\fP and, optionally, modified by \fBgrdmath\fP or \fBgrdhisteq\fP.
.br
When using map projections, the grid is first resampled on a new rectangular grid with the same
dimensions. Higher resolution images can be optained by using the OPT(E) option.
To obtain the resampled value (and hence shade or color) of each map pixel, its location
is inversely projected back onto the input grid after which a value is interpolated between the
surrounding input grid values. By default bi-cubic interpolation is used.
Aliasing is avoided by also forward projecting the input grid nodes. If two or more nodes are
projected onto the same pixel, their average will dominate in the calculation of the pixel
value. Interpolation and aliasing is controlled with the OPT(S) option.
.br
The OPT(R) option can be used to select a map region larger or smaller than that
implied by the extent of the grid.
.br
A (color) \fIPostScript\fP file is output.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-E
Sets the resolution of the projected grid that will be created if
a map projection other than Linear or Mercator was selected.  By default,
the projected grid will be of the same size (rows and columns) as the
input file.  Specify \fBi\fP to use the \fIPostScript\fP
image operator to interpolate the image at the device resolution.
.TP
.B \-G
This option only applies when the resulting image otherwise would consist
of only two colors: black (0) and white (255).  If so, this option will
instead use the image as a transparent mask and paint the mask (or its
inverse, with \fB\-Gb\fP) with the given color combination.
(See SPECIFYING COLOR below).
.TP
.B \-I
Gives the name of a grid file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range. [Default is no illumination].
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-M
Force conversion to monochrome image using the (television) YIQ transformation.
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-Q
Mask out nodes with z = NaN using the colormasking feature in \fIPostScript\fP Level 3
(the PS device must support PS Level 3).
#include "explain_-R.txt"
You may ask for a larger \fIw/e/s/n\fP region to have more room between the image and the axes.
A smaller region than specified in the grid file will result in a subset of the grid
[Default is the region given by the grid file].
#include "explain_-S.txt"
.TP
.B \-T
This option has become OBSOLETE. Use \fBgrdview\fP OPT(T) instead.
Use OPT(Sn) to plot near-neighbor values only (use OPT(E) to increase the resolution).
Use OPT(Sn) OPT(Q) to obtain something similar to the old option OPT(Ts).
The option OPT(To) is no longer supported.
