`Vector Attributes <#toc15>`_
-----------------------------

Several modifiers may be appended to the vector-producing options to
specify the placement of vector heads, their shapes, and the
justification of the vector:

    **+a**\ *angle* sets the angle of the vector head apex [30].

    **+b** places a vector head at the beginning of the vector path [none].

    **+e** places a vector head at the end of the vector path [none].

    **+g**-\|\ *fill* turns off vector head fill (if -) or sets the vector
    head fill [Default fill is used, which may be no fill].

    **+l** draws half-arrows, using only the left side [both].

    **+n**\ *norm* scales down vector attributes (pen thickness, head size)
    with decreasing length, where vectors shorter than *norm* will have
    their attributes scaled by length/\ *norm* [arrow attributes remains
    invariant to length].

    **+p**\ [-][*pen*\ ] sets the vector pen attributes. If *pen* has a
    leading - then the head outline is not drawn. [Default pen is used, and
    head outline is drawn]

    **+r** draws half-arrows, using only the right side [both].

In addition, all but circular vectors may take these modifiers:

    **+j**\ *just* determines how the input *x*,\ *y* point relates to the
    vector. Choose from **b**\ eginning [default], **e**\ nd, or **c**\ enter.

    **+s** means the input *angle*, *length* is instead the *x*, *y*
    coordinates of the vector end point.
