.SS SPECIFYING FONTS

IT(font)
The attributes of text fonts as defined by IT(font) is a comma delimited list of
IT(size), IT(fonttype) and IT(fill), each of which is optional.
IT(size) is the font size (usually in points) but BD(c) or BD(i) can be added to indicate other units.
IT(fonttype) is the name (case sensitive!) of the font or its equivalent numerical ID (e.g., Helvetica-Bold or 1).
IT(fill) specifies the gray shade, color or pattern of the text (see SPECIFYING FILL above).
Optionally, you may append BD(=)IT(pen) to the IT(fill) value in order to draw the text outline;
if used you may optionally skip the text fill by setting it to BD(-).
If any of the attributes is omitted their default or previous setting will be retained.
