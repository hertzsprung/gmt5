IT(color)
The IT(color) of lines, areas and patterns can be specified by a valid color name;
by a gray shade (in the range 0\-255); by a decimal color code (r/g/b, each in range 0\-255; h-s-v, ranges
0\-360, 0\-1, 0\-1; or c/m/y/k, each in range 0\-1); or by a hexadecimal color code (#rrggbb, as used in HTML).
For PDF transparency, append @IT(transparency) in the 0\-100 range [0 or opaque].
See the BD(gmtcolors) manpage for more information and a full list of color names.
