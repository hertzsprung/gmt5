.SH NAME
backtracker \- Reconstruct points, flowlines and hotspot tracks 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbacktracker\fP [\fIinfile(s)\fP] OPT(E)\fIrotations.txt\fP | OPT(e)\fIlon\fP/\fIlat\fP/\fIangle\fP
[ OPT(A)[\fIyoung\fP/\fIold\fP] ] [ OPT(C) ] [ OPT(Df)|\fBb\fP ] [ GMT_H_OPT ] 
[ OPT(Lf)|\fBb\fP\fIstep\fP ] [ OPT(N)\fIupper_age\fP ] 
[ OPT(Q)\fIfixed_age\fP ] [ OPT(S)\fIfilestem\fP ] [ OPT(T)\fIzero_age\fP ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] 
[ OPT(W)[\fBa\fP|\fBt\fP] ] [ GMT_t_OPT ] [ GMT_b_OPT ] [ GMT_m_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbacktracker\fP reads (longitude, latitude, age) positions from \fIinfiles\fP 
[or standard input] and computes rotated (x,y,t) coordinates using the 
specified rotation parameters.  It can either calculate final
positions [Default] or create a sampled track (flowline or hotspot track) between the initial and final
positions.  The former mode allows additional data fields after the first 3
columns which must have (longitude,latitude,age).
See option OPT(:) on how to read (latitude,longitude,age) files.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIinfile(s)\fP
Data file(s) to be projected.  If not given, standard input is read.
#include "euler.txt"
.TP
OPT(e)
Alternatively, specify the longitude, latitude, and opening angle (all in degrees
and separated by /) for a single total reconstruction
rotation that should be applied to all input points.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
OPT(A)
Used in conjunction with OPT(Lb)|\fBf\fP to limit the track output to those sections
whose predicted ages lie between the specified \fIyoung\fP and \fIold\fP limits.  If OPT(LB)|\fBF\fP
is used instead then the limits apply to the stage ids (id 1 is the youngest stage).  If no limits are specified
then individual limits for each record are expected in columns 4 and 5 of the input file.
.TP
OPT(C)
Expect Total Reconstruction Rotations rather than Forward Stage Rotations [Default].
File format is similar to the stage pole format except that the \fItstart\fP column
is not present (assumed to be 0 Ma).  Requires OPT(E).
.TP
OPT(D)
Set the direction to go: OPT(Df) will go backward in time (from younger to older positions), while
OPT(Db) will go forward in time (from older to younger positions) [Default].  Note: For OPT(Db) you
are specifying the age at the given location, whereas for OPT(Df)
you are not; instead you specify the age at the reconstructed point.
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
OPT(L)
Specify a sampled path between initial and final position: OPT(Lf) will
draw particle flowlines, while OPT(Lb) will draw backtrack (hotspot track) paths.
Append sampling interval in km.  If \fIstep\fP < 0 then only the rotation times
will be returned.  When OPT(LF) or OPT(LB) is used, the
third output column will contain the stage id (1 is youngest) [Default is
along-track predicted ages].  You can control the direction of the paths
by using OPT(D).
.TP
OPT(N)
Set the maximum age to extend the oldest stage rotation back in time [Default is no extension].
.TP
OPT(Q)
Assign a fixed age to all positions.  Only lon, lat input is expected [Default expects longitude, latitude, age].
Useful when the input are points defining isochrons.
.TP
OPT(S)
When OPT(L) is set, the tracks are normally written to stdout as a multisegment
file.  Specify a \fIfilestem\fP to have each track written to \fIfilestem.#\fP, where
\fI#\fP is the track number.  The track number is also copied to the 4th output column.
.TP
OPT(T)
Set the current time [Default is 0 Ma].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)
Rotates the given input (lon,lat,t) and calculates the confidence ellipse for the
projected point.  The input point \fImust\fP have a time coordinate that exactly matches
a particular finite rotation time, otherwise the point will be skipped.  Append
\fBt\fP or \fBa\fP to output time or angle, respectively, after the projected
lon, lat.  After these 2-3 items, we write azimuth, major, minor (in km) for the
95% confidence ellipse.  See OPT(D) for the direction of rotation.

.SH EXAMPLES
To backtrack the (x,y,t) points in the file seamounts.d to their origin
(presumably the hotspot), using the DC85.d Euler poles, run
.br
.sp
\fBbacktracker\fP seamounts.d OPT(Db) OPT(E)DC85.d > newpos.d
.br
.sp
To project flowlines forward from the (x,y,t) points stored in several 3-column,
binary, double precision files, run
.br
.sp
\fBbacktracker\fP points.* OPT(Df) OPT(E)DC85.d OPT(Lf)25 OPT(bo) OPT(bi)\fI3\fP > lines.b
.br
.sp
This file can then be plotted with \fBpsxy \-M\fP.
