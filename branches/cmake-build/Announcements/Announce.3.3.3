Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT 3.3.3.
This version fixes numerous bugs (some discussed in
the GMT 3.3.2 Errata page) and will for the first time
use GNU configure script to do the install.  A top-
level Makefile has also been added, which runs the
actual installation (from install_gmt or manually). The
installation has been simplified by providing a web-
based form where you can indicate your preferences
and have a customized install parameter file returned
to be used with the new install_gmt script.  This allows
you to do the install in the background.  You may also
run it interactively as in the past.  With these
changes, we hope GMT 3.3.3 will be our most stable release
to date.  For more details see the Release link on the
GMT web page (http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt) and the
new section on Installation.

While mostly dealing with bugfixes, a few new options
have been added to some programs in GMT 3.3.3.
grdimage and grdview takes -T to plot an image without
any interpolation, and psxy can use -C with polygon
files and -M to give polygons colers via cpt lookup.

Finally, the practice of using lib as the directory
for common data files and coastlines has come to an
end.  From now on this directory is referred to as
share.  Since the coastline files themselves have not
changed you do not need to copy the full and high
coastlines again, just move then to the new share
directory.

While this release comes very close to the Fall AGU
meeting, we feel it is worth your effort to upgrade.
However, from experience we know that it is possible
to introduce a new problem by fixing two bugs; hence
we recommend AGU participants to keep their earlier
version intact until the meeting is over.

Sincerely,

Paul Wessel
