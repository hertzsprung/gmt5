Draws a simple map directional rose centered on \fIlon0/lat0\fP.  Use \fB\-Tx\fP to specify x/y position instead.
The \fIsize\fP is the diameter of the rose, and optional label information can be specified to override
the default values of W, E, S, and N.  The default [plain] map rose only labels north.  Use \fB\-Tf\fP to get a "fancy" rose, and specify what
\fIkind\fP of rose you want drawn.  The default [1] draws the two principal E-W, N-S orientations, 2 adds the
two intermediate NW-SE and NE-SW orientations, while 3 adds the eight minor orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW,
and ENE-WSW.  For a magnetic compass rose, specify \fB\-Tm\fP.  If given, \fIinfo\fP must be the two parameters
\fIdec/dlabel\fP, where \fIdec\fP is the magnetic declination and \fIdlabel\fP is a label for the magnetic compass
needle.  Then, both directions to geographic and magnetic north are plotted [Default is geographic only].  If the
north label = * then a north star is plotted instead of the north label.  Annotation interval for geographic and
magnetic directions are 10 and 30 degrees, respectively; override these settings by appending +\fIgint\fP[/\fImint\fP].
Color and pen attributes are taken from COLOR_BACKGROUND and TICK_PEN, respectively, while label fonts and sizes
are the usual annotation, label, and header font settings.
