.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(grdtrack) reads one or more grid files (or a Sandwell/Smith IMG files) and a table (from file or
standard input; but see OPT(E) for exception) with (x,y) [or (lon,lat)] positions 
in the first two columns (more columns may be present). It interpolates the grid(s) at the positions 
in the table and writes out the table with the interpolated values added as (one or more) new columns.
Alternatively (OPT(C)), the input is considered to be line-segments and we create orthogonal cross-profiles
at each data point or with an equidistant separation and sample the grid(s) along these profiles.
A bicubic 
[Default], bilinear, B-spline or nearest-neighbor (see OPT(n)) interpolation is used, requiring boundary conditions at the limits 
of the region (see OPT(n); Default uses "natural" conditions (second partial derivative normal to edge is zero) unless
the grid is automatically recognized as periodic.)

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(G)IT(gridfile)
IT(grdfile) is a 2-D binary grid file with the function f(x,y).
If the specified grid is in Sandwell/Smith Mercator format you must append a comma-separated list of
arguments that includes a scale to multiply the data (usually 1 or 0.1), the mode which stand for the following:
(0) Img files with no constraint code, returns data at all points, (1) Img file with constraints coded,
return data at all points, (2) Img file with constraints coded, return data only at constrained points
and NaN elsewhere, and (3) Img file with constraints coded, return 1 at constraints and 0 elsewhere,
and optionally the max latitude in the IMG file [80.738].  You may repeat OPT(G) as many times as you
have grids you wish to sample.  The grids are sampled and results are output in the order given.
(See GRID FILE FORMAT below.)
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(xyfile)
This is an ASCII (or binary, see GMT_bi_OPT) file where the first 2 columns hold the (x,y) positions where the user wants to sample
the 2-D data set.
.TP
OPT(A)BD(f)|BD(p)BD(m)|BD(r)|BD(R)
For track resampling (if OPT(C) is set) we can select how this is to be performed. Append
BD(f) to keep original points, but add intermediate points if needed [Default],
BD(m) as BD(f), but first follow meridian (along y) then parallel (along x),
BD(p) as BD(f), but first follow parallel (along y) then meridian (along x),
BD(r) to resample at equidistant locations; input points are not necessarily included in the output, and
BD(R) as BD(r), but adjust given spacing to fit the track length exactly.
Finally, append BD(+l) if distances should be measured along rhumb lines (loxodromes).
Ignored unless OPT(C) is used.
.TP
OPT(C)IT(length)/IT(ds)[/IT(spacing)]
Use input line segments to create an equidistant and (optionally) equally-spaced set of crossing profiles along which
we sample the grid(s) [Default simply samples the grid(s) at the input locations].
Specify two length scales that control how the sampling is done:
IT(length) sets the full length of each cross-profile, while
IT(ds) is the distance increment along each cross-profile.
Optionally, append BD(/)IT(spacing) for an equidistant spacing between cross-profiles [Default erects cross-profiles at the input coordinates].
By default, all cross-profiles have the same direction.  Append BD(+a) to alternate the direction of cross-profiles.
Append suitable units to IT(length); it sets the unit used for IT(ds) [and IT(spacing)] (See UNITS below).
The output columns will be IT(lon), IT(lat), IT(dist), IT(azimuth), IT(z1), IT(z2), ... (sampled value for each grid)
.TP
OPT(D)IT(dfile)
In concert with OPT(C) we can save the (possibly resampled) original lines to the
file IT(dfile) [Default only saves the cross-profiles].
The columns will be IT(lon), IT(lat), IT(dist), IT(azimuth), IT(z1), IT(z2), ... (sampled value for each grid)
.TP
OPT(E)IT(line)[,IT(line),...][+iIT(inc)[BD(u)]]
Instead of reading input track coordinates, specify profiles via their end coordinates.
The format of each IT)line) is IT(start)/IT(stop), where IT(start) or IT(stop)
are IT(lon)/IT(lat) (IT(x)/IT(y) for Cartesian data) or a 2-character XY key that uses the "pstext"-style justification format
format to specify a point on the map as [LCR][BMT].  In addition, you can use Z-, Z+ to mean
the global minimum and maximum locations in the grid (only available if only one grid is given).  Note: No track file is read.
Append BD(+i)BD(inc)[BD(u)] to set the sampling interval (append appropriate unit).  If no increment is given
then we default to half the minimum grid interval, and if geographic we select great circle distances in km as the default unit
and method.
.TP
OPT(N)
Do IT(not) skip points that fall outside the domain of the grid(s) [Default only output points within grid domain].
#include "explain_-R.txt"
.TP
OPT(S)IT(method)/IT(modifiers)
In conjunction with OPT(C), compute a single stacked profile from all profiles across each segment.
Append how stacking should be computed: BD(a) = mean (average), BD(m) = median, BD(p) = mode (maximum likelihood),
BD(l) = lower, BD(L) = lower but only consider positive values, BD(u) = upper, BD(U) = upper but only consider negative values [BD(a)].
The IT(modifiers) control the output; choose one or more among these choices:
BD(+a) : Append stacked values to all cross-profiles.
BD(+d) : Append stack deviations to all cross-profiles.
BD(+d) : Append data residuals (data - stack) to all cross-profiles.
BD(+s)[IT(file)] : Save stacked profile to IT(file) [grdtrack_stacked_profile.txt].
BD(+c)IT(fact) : Compute envelope on stacked profile as +/- IT(fact)*IT(deviation) [2].
Notes: (1) Deviations depend on IT(method) and are st.dev (BD(a)), L1 scale (BD(e) and BD(p)), or half-range (upper-lower)/2.
(2) The stacked profile file contains 1 plus groups of 4-6 columns, one group for each sampled grid.  The first column holds
cross distance, while the first 4 in a group hold stacked value, deviation, min value, and max value.
If IT(method) is one of BD(a)|BD(m)|BD(p) then we also write the lower and upper confidence bounds (see BD(+c)).
When one or more of BD(+a), BD(+d), and BD(+r) are used then we append the results to the end of each row for all cross-profiles.
The order is always stacked value (BD(+a)), followed by deviations (BD(+d)) and residuals (BD(+r)).  When more than
one grid is sampled this sequence of 1-3 columns are repeated for each grid.

.SH HINTS
If an interpolation point is not on a node of the input grid, then a NaN at any node in the neighborhood 
surrounding the point will yield an interpolated NaN.  Bicubic interpolation [default] yields continuous 
first derivatives but requires a neighborhood of 4 nodes by 4 nodes.  Bilinear interpolation [OPT(n)] 
uses only a 2 by 2 neighborhood, but yields only zeroth-order continuity.  Use bicubic when smoothness is 
important.  Use bilinear to minimize the propagation of NaNs, or lower IT(threshold).
