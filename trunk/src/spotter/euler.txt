.TP
.B \-E
Give file with rotation parameters.  This file must contain
one record for each rotation; each record must be of the following format:
.br
.sp
	\fIlon lat tstart [tstop] angle\fP [ \fIkhat a b c d e f g df\fP ]
.br
.sp
where \fItstart\fP and \fItstop\fP are in Myr and \fIlon lat angle\fP are in degrees.
\fItstart\fP and \fItstop\fP are the ages of the old and young ends of a stage.  If OPT(C) is set then a total
reconstruction rotation is expected and \fItstop\fP is implicitly set to 0 and
should not be specified in the file.  If a covariance matrix \fBC\fP for the rotation is available
it must be specified in a format using the nine optional terms listed in brackets.
Here, \fBC\fP = (\fIg\fP/\fIkhat\fP)*[ \fIa b d; b c e; d e f\fP ] which shows \fBC\fP
made up of three row vectors.
If the degrees of freedom (\fIdf\fP) in fitting the rotation is 0 or not given it is set to 10000.
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
