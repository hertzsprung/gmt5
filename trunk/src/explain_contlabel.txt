#ifdef CONTOUR
#define LINETYPE contours

Controls the placement of labels along the LINETYPE.

The required argument controls the placement of labels along the LINETYPE.

Choose among five controlling algorithms:
.RS
.TP
GFLAG\fBd\fP\fIdist\fP[c|i|m|p] or GFLAG\fBD\fP\fIdist\fP[d|e|k|m|n]
For lower case \fBd\fP, give distances between labels on the plot in your preferred measurement unit
\fBc\fP (cm), \fBi\fP (inch), \fBm\fP (meter), or \fBp\fP (points), while for upper case \fBD\fP, specify
distances in map units and append the unit; choose among \fBe\fP (m), \fBk\fP (km), \fBm\fP (mile), \fBn\fP
(nautical mile), or \fBd\fP (spherical degree).  [Default is G_OPT_SI or G_OPT_US].  
.TP
GFLAG\fBf\fP\fIffile.d\fP
Reads the ascii file \fIffile.d\fP and places labels at locations in the file
that matches locations along the LINETYPE.
Inexact matches and points outside the region are skipped.
.TP
GFLAG\fBl|L\fP\fIline1\fP[,\fIline2\fP,...]
Give \fIstart\fP and \fIstop\fP coordinates for one or
more comma-separated straight line segments.  Labels will be placed where these lines intersect the
LINETYPE.  The format of each \fIline\fP specification is \fIstart/stop\fP, where \fIstart\fP and \fIstop\fP
are either a specified point \fIlon/lat\fP or a 2-character \fBXY\fP key that uses the justification
format employed in \fBpstext\fP to indicate a point on the map, given as [LCR][BMT].
#ifdef GRID
In addition, you may use Z+ and Z- which correspond to the locations of the global max and min locations in
the grid, respectively.
#endif
GFLAG\fBL\fP will interpret the point pairs as defining great circles [Default is straight line].
.TP
GFLAG\fBn\fP\fIn_label\fP
Specifies the number of equidistant labels for LINETYPE line [1].
Upper case GFLAG\fBN\fP starts labeling exactly at the start of the line [Default centers them along the line].
GFLAG\fBN\fP-1 places one justified label at start, while GFLAG\fBN\fP+1 places one justified
label at the end of LINETYPE.
Optionally, append /\fImin_dist\fP[c|i|m|p] to enforce that a minimum distance separation
between successive labels is enforced.
.TP
GFLAG\fBx|X\fP\fIxfile.d\fP
Reads the multi-segment file \fIxfile.d\fP and places labels at the intersections
between the LINETYPE and the lines in\fIxfile.d\fP.  GFLAG\fBX\fP will resample the lines first along
great-circle arcs.
.RE
In addition, you may optionally append :\fIradius\fP[c|i|m|p] to set a minimum label separation in the
x-y plane [no limitation].
