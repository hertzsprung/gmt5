.TP
.B \-Q
Quick mode, use bilinear rather than bicubic interpolation [Default].
Alternatively, select the interpolation mode by adding \fBb\fP for B-spline smooting,
\fBc\fP for bicubic interpolation, \fBl\fP for bilinear interpolation or \fBn\fP for
nearest-neighbor value.
Optionally, append \fIthreshold\fP in the range [0,1].
This parameter controls how close to nodes with NaN values the
interpolation will go.  E.g., a \fIthreshold\fP of 0.5 will interpolate about half way from a non-NaN to a
NaN node, whereas 0.1 will go about 90% of the way, etc. [Default is 1, which means none of the (4 or 16) nearby
nodes may be NaN].  OPT(Q0) will just return the value of the nearest node instead of interpolating.
This is the same as using OPT(Qn).
