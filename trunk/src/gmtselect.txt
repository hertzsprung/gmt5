.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmtselect\fP is a filter that reads (longitude, latitude) positions from the first 2 columns of
\fIinfiles\fP [or standard input] and uses a combination of 1-6 criteria to pass or reject the records.
Records can be selected based on whether or not they are 1) inside a rectangular region (\fB\-R\fP
[and \fB\-J\fP]), 2) within \fIdist\fP km of any point in \fIptfile\fP, 3) within \fIdist\fP km of
any line in \fIlinefile\fP, 4) inside one of the polygons in the \fIpolygonfile\fP, 5) inside
geographical features (based on coastlines), or 6) has z-values within a given range.
The sense of the tests can be reversed for each of these 6 criteria by using the \fB\-I\fP option.
See option \fB\-:\fP on how to read (latitude,longitude) files.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIinfiles\fP
ASCII (or binary, see\fB\-b\fP) data file(s) to be operated on.  If not given, standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Ignored unless \fB\-N\fP is set.  Geographical features with an area smaller than \fImin_area\fP
in km^2 or of hierarchical level that is lower than \fImin_level\fP or higher than \fImax_level\fP
will be ignored [Default is 0/4 (all features)]. See DATABASE INFORMATION in the \fBpscoast\fP man-pages for more details.
.TP
.B \-C
Pass all records whose location is within \fIdist\fP of any of the points in the ASCII file \fIptfile\fP.  If \fIdist\fP
is zero then the 3rd column of \fIptfile\fP must have each point's\"'
individual radius of influence.  Distances are in user units; specify
\fB\-fg\fP or a map projection to indicate distances in km.  Prepend \fBf\fP to indicate you want approximate flat
earth distance calculations (faster) rather than exact geodesic distances (slower).  However, if the current ELLIPSOID
is set to Sphere then spherical great circle calculations are used.
.TP
.B \-D
Ignored unless \fB\-N\fP is set.  Selects the resolution of the coastline data set to use ((\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, or (\fBc\fP)rude).  The
resolution drops off by ~80% between data sets. [Default is \fBl\fP].  Note that because the coastlines differ in details it is not guaranteed that a point will remain inside [or outside] when a different resolution is selected.
.TP
.B \-F
Pass all records whose location is within one of the closed polygons in the multiple-segment
ASCII file \fIpolygonfile\fP.  For spherical polygons (lon, lat), make sure no consecutive points
are separated by 180 degrees or more.
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-I
Reverses the sense of the test for each of the criteria specified:
.br
	\fBc\fP  select records NOT inside any point's circle of influence.\"'
.br
	\fBf\fP  select records NOT inside any of the polygons.
.br
	\fBl\fP  select records NOT within the specified distance of any line.
.br
	\fBr\fP  select records NOT inside the specified rectangular region.
.br
	\fBs\fP  select records NOT considered inside as specified by \fB\-A, \-D, \-N\fP.
.br
	\fBz\fP  select records NOT within the range specified by \fB\-Z\fP.
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Pass all records whose location is within \fIdist\fP of any of the line segments in the multiple-segment ascii
file \fIlinefile\fP.  If \fIdist\fP is zero then the 2nd column of each
sub-header in the \fIptfile\fP must have each lines's individual distance value.\"'
Distances are in user units; specify \fB\-fg\fP or a map projection to indicate distances in km.
.TP
.B \-M
Multiple segment file.  Segments are separated by a record whose first character is \fIflag\fP.
[Default is '>'].
.TP
.B \-N
Pass all records whose location is inside specified geographical features.
Specify if records should be skipped (s) or kept (k) using 1 of 2 formats:
.br
	\fB\-N\fP\fIwet/dry\fP.
.br
	\fB\-N\fP\fIocean/land/lake/island/pond\fP.
.br
Append \fBo\fP to let points exactly on feature boundaries be considered outside the feature [Default is inside]. [Default is s/k/s/k/s (i.e., s/k), which passes all points on dry land].
.TP
.B \-Z
Pass all records whose 3rd colum (z) lies within the given range.  Input file must have at least
three columns.  To indicate no limit on min or max, specify a hyphen (-).
#include "explain_-R.txt"
If no map projection is supplied we implicitly set \fB\-Jx\fP1.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-i_binary.txt"
#include "explain_-n.txt"
[Default is 2 input columns].

.SH EXAMPLES
To extract the subset of data set that is within 300 km of any of the points in pts.d but more than
100 km away from the lines in lines.d, run
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP lonlatfile \fB\-Jd\fP1d \fB\-C\fP300/pts.d \fB\-L\fP100/lines.d \fB\-Il\fP > subset
.br
.sp
Here, you must specify a map projection so that knows you are giving it geographical data (otherwise
300 would be interpreted as Cartesian distance in x-y units instead of km).
.br
.sp
To keep all points in data.d within the specified region, except the points on land (as determined by the high-resolution
coastlines), use
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP data.d \fB\-R\fP120/121/22/24 \fB\-Dh\fP \fB\-Ns\fP/\fBk\fP > subset
.br
To return all points in quakes.d that are inside the spherical polygon lonlatpath.d, try
coastlines), use
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP quakes.d \fB\-F\fPlonlatpath.d \fB\-fg\fP > subset
