OPT(m)
Multiple segment file(s).  Segments are separated by a special record.
For ASCII files the first character must be \fIflag\fP [Default is '>'].
For binary files all fields must be NaN and OPT(b) must
set the number of output columns explicitly.  By default the OPT(m)
setting applies to both input and output.  Use OPT(mi) and OPT(mo)
to give separate settings.
