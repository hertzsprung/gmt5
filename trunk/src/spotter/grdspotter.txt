.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdspotter\fP reads a grid file with residual bathymetry or gravity
and calculates flowlines using the  specified stage pole (Euler) rotations.
These flowlines are convolved with the volume of the prism represented by
each grid node and added up to give a Cumulative Volcano Amplitude grid (CVA).
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIgrdfile\fP
Data grid to be processed. 
.TP
.B \-E
Give file with stage poles and opening angles.  This file must contain
one record for each stage; each record must be of the following format:
.br
.sp
	lon lat tstart tstop ccw-angle
.br
.sp
where tstart and tstop are in Ma and the rest is in degrees.  The oldest stage
must be listed first.  tstart (tstop) is the age of the old (young) end of the
stage.  Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-G
Specify name for output grid file.

#include "explain_-Rgeo.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Supply a crustal age grid that is co-ergistered with the input data grid.  These ages
become the upper ages to use when constructing flowlines [Default extent flowlines back
to oldest age].
.TP
.B \-B
Get \fIn_try\fP bootstrap estimates of the maximum CVA location; the results are written
to stdout [Default is no bootstrapping]
.TP
.B \-C
Expect Total Reconstruction Poles (Finite Poles) rather than Backward Stage Poles [Default]
File format is similar to the stage pole format except the youngest rotation must be listed
first and that the tstart column is optional (assumed to be 0 Ma).
.TP
.B \-D
Use flowlines to determine the max CVA encountered along each flowline and create a Data
Importance (DI) grid with these values at the originating nodes.
.TP
.B \-F
Force pixel registration [Default is grid registration].
TP
.B \-L
Supply a co-ergistered grid with seamount chain IDs for each nodes.
.TP
.B \-N
Set the upper age to assign seamounts whose crustal age is unknown (i.e. NaN) [no upper age].
.TP
.B \-P
Use flowlines to determine the flowline age for each node and create a Predicted
Age (PA) grid with these values at the originating nodes.
.TP
.B \-Q
Either give a single ID to use or a filename of a file with list of IDs [Default uses all IDs].
Each line would be TAG ID [w e s n] (the w/e/s/n zoom box is optional).
.TP
.B \-S
Normalize the resulting CVA grid to percentages of the CVA maximum.
.TP
.B \-T
Truncate seamount ages exceeding the upper age set with \fB\-N\fP [no truncation].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-Z
Ignore nodes with z-values lower than \fIz_min\fP [0] and optionally larger than \fIz_max\fP [Inf].
Give \fIz_min/z_max/z_inc\fP to make separate CVA grids for each \fIz\fP-slice {Default makes one CVA grid].
.SH EXAMPLES
To create a CVA image from the Pacific topography grid Pac_res_topo.grd,
using the DC85.d Euler poles, and only output a grid for the specified domain, run
.br
.sp
\fBgrdspotter\fP Pac_res_topo.grd \fB\-E\fPDC85.d \fB\-G\fPCVA.grd \fB\-R\fP190/220/15/25 \fB\-I\fP2\fBm \-N\fP145 \fB\-T \-V\fP
.br
.sp
This file can then be plotted with \fBgrdimage\fP.
