Select binary output.  Append one or more comma-separated combinations of
IT(ncols)/IT(type), where IT(ncols) is the actual number of data columns
and IT(type) must be one of BD(c), BD(u), BD(h), BD(H), BD(i), BD(I),
BD(l), BD(L), BD(f), and BD(d) (see OPT(bi)).  Append BD(w) or
BD(+L)|BD(B) for byte-swapping.  IT(ncols) is the number of each item in
the binary file.  If no IT(ncols) is specified we assume that IT(type)
applies to all columns and that IT(ncols) is implied by the default output
of the program.  NetCDF file output is not supported.
