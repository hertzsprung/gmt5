.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpscoast\fP plots grayshaded, colored, or textured land-masses [or water-masses] on maps and [optionally]
draws coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.  Alternatively, it can (1) issue clip paths that will
contain all land or all water areas, or (2) dump the data to an ASCII table.  The data files come in 5 different resolutions:
(\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, and (\fBc\fP)rude.  The full resolution files amount to more than 55 Mb
of data and provide great detail; for maps of larger geographical extent it is more economical to use
one of the other resolutions.  If the user selects to paint the land-areas and does not specify fill of
water-areas then the latter will be transparent (i.e., earlier graphics drawn in those areas will not
be overwritten).  Likewise, if the water-areas are painted and no land fill is set then the land-areas
will be transparent.  A map projection must be supplied.  The \fIPostScript\fP code is written to standard output.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
#include "explain_-A.txt"
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
OPT(C)
Set the shade, color, or pattern for lakes and river-lakes  [Default is the fill chosen for "wet" areas (OPT(S))].
Optionally, specify separate fills by prepending \fBl\fP/ for lakes and \fBr\fP/ for river-lakes, repeating
the OPT(C) option as needed.
(See SPECIFYING FILL below).
.TP
OPT(D)
Selects the resolution of the data set to use ((\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, and (\fBc\fP)rude).  The
resolution drops off by 80% between data sets  [Default is \fBl\fP].  Append \fP+\fP to automatically select a lower resolution should
the one requested not be available [abort if not found].
#include "explain_-E.txt"
.TP
OPT(G)
Select filling or clipping of "dry" areas.  Append the shade, color, or pattern (see SPECIFYING FILL below);
or use OPT(Gc) for clipping [Default is no fill].
.TP
OPT(I)
Draw rivers.  Specify the type of rivers and [optionally] append pen attributes  [Default pen:
width = 0.25p, color = black, texture = solid].
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
.br
Choose from the list of river types below.
Repeat option OPT(I) as often as necessary.
.br
	 1 = Permanent major rivers
.br
	 2 = Additional major rivers
.br
	 3 = Additional rivers
.br
	 4 = Minor rivers
.br
	 5 = Intermittent rivers - major
.br
	 6 = Intermittent rivers - additional
.br
	 7 = Intermittent rivers - minor
.br
	 8 = Major canals
.br

.TP
OPT(N)
Draw political boundaries.  Specify the type of boundary and [optionally] append pen attributes  [Default pen:
width = 0.25p, color = black, texture = solid]. (See SPECIFYING PENS below).
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
.br
Choose from the list of boundaries below.
Repeat option OPT(N) as often as necessary.
.br
	1 = National boundaries

.br
	a = All boundaries (1-3)

.TP
OPT(Q)
Mark end of existing clip path.  No projection information is needed.
However, you must supply OPT(Xa) and OPT(Ya) settings if you are using absolute positioning.
.TP
OPT(S)
Select filling or clipping of "wet" areas.  Append the shade, color, or pattern (see SPECIFYING FILL below);
or use OPT(Sc) for clipping [Default is no fill].
#include "explain_-T_rose.txt"
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)
Draw shorelines [Default is no shorelines].  Append pen attributes  [Defaults:
width = 0.25p, color = black, texture = solid] which apply to all four levels.  To set
the pen for each level differently, prepend \fIlevel\fP/, where \fIlevel\fP is 1-4
and represent coastline, lakeshore, island-in-lake shore, and lake-in-island-in-lake shore.
Repeat OPT(W) as needed.  When specific level pens are set, those not listed will not
be drawn [Default draws all levels; but see OPT(A)].
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
#include "explain_-XY.txt"
.TP
OPT(Z)
For 3-D projections:  Sets the z-level of the coastlines [0].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
#include "explain_-c.txt"
.TP
OPT(m)
Dumps a single multisegment ASCII (or binary, see OPT(bo)) file to standard output.  No plotting occurs.
Specify any combination of OPT(W), OPT(I), OPT(N).  Optionally, you may append the
\fIflag\fP character that is written at the start of each segment header ['>'].

\fBpscoast\fP will first look for coastline files in directory \fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/coast
If the desired file is not found, it will look for the file
\fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/coastline.conf.  This file may contain any number of records that
each holds the full pathname of an alternative directory.  Comment lines (#) and blank lines
are allowed.  The desired file is then sought for in the alternate directories.

.SH BUGS
The options to fill (OPT(C) OPT(G) OPT(S)) may not always work if the Azimuthal equidistant projection is
chosen (OPT(Je)|\fBE\fP).  If the antipole of the projection is in the oceans it will most likely work.
If not, try to avoid using projection center coordinates that are even multiples of the coastline
bin size (1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 degrees for \fBf, h, i, l, c\fP, respectively).  This projection is
not supported for clipping.
.br
The political borders are for the most part 1970ies-style and do not reflect the recent
border rearrangements in Europe.  We intend to update these as high-resolution data become
available to us.
.br
Some users of \fBpscoast\fP will not be satisfied with what they find for the
Antarctic shoreline.  In Antarctica, the boundary between ice and 
ocean varies seasonally and inter-annually.  There are some areas of 
permanent sea ice.  In addition to these time-varying ice-ocean 
boundaries, there are also ice grounding lines where ice goes from 
floating on the sea to sitting on land, and lines delimiting areas 
of rock outcrop.  For consistency's sake, we have used the World\"'
Vector Shoreline throughout the world in pscoast, as described in
the \fBGMT\fP Cookbook Appendix K. Users who need specific boundaries
in Antarctica should get the Antarctic Digital Database, prepared
by the British Antarctic Survey, Scott Polar Research Institute,
World Conservation Monitoring Centre, under the auspices of the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.  This data base contains
various kinds of limiting lines for Antarctica and is available on
CD-ROM.  It is published by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research, Scott Polar Research Institute, Lensfield Road, Cambridge
CB2 1ER, United Kingdom.
