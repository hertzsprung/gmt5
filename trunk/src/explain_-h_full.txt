GMT_h_OPT
Input file(s) has header record(s). If used, the default number of
header records is BD(IO_N_HEADER_RECS) [0]. Use OPT(hi) if only
input data should have header records [Default will write out header
records if the input data have them]. Blank lines and lines starting
with # are always skipped. For output you may request additional headers
to be written via the option modifiers, and use BD(+d) to remove existing
header records. If used with native binary data we
interpret IT(n) to instead mean the number of bytes to skip on input
or pad on output.
