[ GMT_bi_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoriginator\fP reads (longitude, latitude, height, radius, crustal_age) records from \fIinfiles\fP 
[or standard input] and uses the given Absolute Plate Motion (APM) stage
poles and the list of hotspot locations to determine the most likely origin (hotspot)
for each seamount.  It does so by calculating flowlines back in time and determining
the closest approach to all hotspots.  The output consists of the input records with
four additional fields added for each of the \fIn_hs\fP closest hotspots.  The four fields
are the hotspot id (e.g., HWI), the stage id of the flowline segment that came closest,
the pseudo-age of the seamount, and the closest distance to the hotspot (in km).
See option \fB\-:\fP on how to read (latitude, longitude,height, radius, crustal_ag) files.

	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIinfile(s)\fP
Seamount data file(s) to be analyzed.  If not given, standard input is read.
#include "euler.txt"
#include "hotspot.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-C
Expect Total Reconstruction Poles rather than Backward Stage Poles [Default].
File format is similar to the stage pole format except the youngest rotation must be listed
first and that the tstart column is optional (assumed to be 0 Ma).
.TP
.B \-D
Sets the flowline sampling interval in km.  [Default is 5].
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Output closest approach for nearest hotspot only (ignores OPT(S)).
Choose OPT(Lt) for (\fItime, dist, z\fP) [Default], OPT(Lw) for (\fIomega, dist, z\fP),
and OPT(Ll) for (lon, lat, time, dist, z).  Normally, \fIdist\fP is in km; use
upper case modifiers \fBTWL\fP to get \fIdist\fP in spherical degrees.
.TP
.B \-N
Set the maximum age to extend the oldest stage back in time [no extension].
.TP
.B \-Q
.TP
INput files only has (\fIx,y,z\fP); specify constant values for \fIr,t\fP that
will be implied for each record.
.B \-S
Set the number of closest hotspots to report [Default is 1].
.TP
.B \-T
Truncate seamount ages exceeding the upper age set with \fB\-N\fP [no truncation].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Only report those seamounts whose flowlines came within \fImaxdist\fP to any hotspot
[Default reports all seamounts].
.TP
.B \-Z
Use the hotspot ID number rather than the name tag in output records.
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 5 input columns].
.SH EXAMPLES
To find the likely (hotspot) origins of the seamounts represented by the (x,y,z,r,tc) points
in the file seamounts.d, using the DC85.d Euler poles and the pac_hs.d list of possible hotspots,
and report the 2 most likely hotspot candidates for each seamount, run
