GMT_bo_OPT
Selects binary output. Append one or more comma-separated combinations of
IT(n)IT(type), where IT(type) is one of BD(c) (signed byte),
BD(u) (unsigned byte), BD(h) (signed 2-byte int), BD(H) (unsigned
2-byte int), BD(i) (signed 4-byte int), BD(I) (unsigned 4-byte int),
BD(l) (signed 8-byte int), BD(L) (unsigned 8-byte int), BD(f)
(4-byte single-precision float), and BD(d) (8-byte double-precision
float).  Append BD(w) to any item to force byte-swapping.
Alternatively, append BD(+L)|BD(B) to indicate that the entire data file
should be written as little- or big-endian, respectively.
Here, IT(n) is the number of each items in your binary input file; the
total may exceeds the columns actually needed by the program.  If no
IT(n) is specified we assume that IT(type) applies to all columns and
that IT(n) is implied by the default output of the program.
NetCDF file output is not supported.
