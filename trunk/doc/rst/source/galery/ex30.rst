(30) Trigonometric functions plotted in graph mode
--------------------------------------------------

Finally, we end with a simple mathematical illustration of sine and
cosine, highlighting the *graph* mode for linear projections and the new
curved vectors for angles.

The script simply draws a graph basemap, computes sine and cosine and
plots them as lines, then indicates on a circle that these quantities
are simply the projections of an unit vector on the x- and y-axis, at
the given angle.
