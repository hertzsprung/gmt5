Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 3.4.
This version fixes numerous bugs, only some of which have
been listed on the official errata page for 3.3.6; for more
details follow the Release link on the new GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

While mostly dealing with bugfixes, a few new options have
been added to some programs:

1. grdvector has a new option (-Sf) to plot fixed length
   vectors.
   
2. minmax has a new option (-D) to shift the longitude
   discontinuity to the Dateline [Default is Greenwich].
   
3. surface will now give an error if more than one input
   file is given.  Previously it would just process the
   last file only without warnings. 

4. grdcontour -A[...]t will now draw transparent label
   boxes (thanks to Kaj Jancke.)

5. xyz2grd can now handle multiple input files (except
   when -S is used).

6. DEGREE_FORMAT has 6 new options for degree and decimal
   minute formatting.

Also, to avoid UNIX namespace conflicts we provide a wrapper
script called GMT which may be installed in /usr/bin (or
some other standard path).  By prefacing any GMT command
with "GMT " it can start commands from directories not in
your path.  At the moment, this will benefit those who are
using the Seismic Unix package which contains a pstext tool.
To ensure you get the GMT pstext, you can run

GMT pstext -R -J ...

Likewise, a GMT man page may be installed in /usr/man.

Sincerely,

Paul Wessel
