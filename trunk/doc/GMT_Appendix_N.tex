\chapter{Custom Plot Symbols}
\label{app:N}
\index{symbols!custom}
\thispagestyle{headings}

\GMT\ comes with several custom plot symbols ready to go.  They are used in \GMTprog{psxy}
and \GMTprog{psxyz} using the \Opt{Sk} option.  To make your own custom plot symbol,
please follow the instructions given in the man pages of those two programs.  The following is
a plot of each symbol.  Note that we only show the symbol outline and not any fill.
Be aware that some symbols may have a hardwired fill or no-fill component. Also
note that some symbols, in particular the geometric ones, duplicate what
is already available as standard built-in symbols. \\ 

\GMTfig[h]{GMT_App_N_1}{Custom plot symbols supported by \gmt.}
