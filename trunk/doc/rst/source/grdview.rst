`Description <#toc2>`_
----------------------

**grdview** reads a 2-D grid file and produces a 3-D perspective plot by
drawing a mesh, painting a colored/grayshaded surface made up of
polygons, or by scanline conversion of these polygons to a raster image.
Options include draping a data set on top of a surface, plotting of
contours on top of the surface, and apply artificial illumination based
on intensities provided in a separate grid file. 

`Required Arguments <#toc4>`_
-----------------------------

*relief\_file*
    2-D gridded data set to be imaged (the relief of the surface). (See
    GRID FILE FORMAT below.) 

.. include:: explain_-J.rst_

.. include:: explain_-Jz.rst_

`Optional Arguments <#toc5>`_
-----------------------------

.. include:: explain_-B.rst_

**-C**\ [*cptfile*]
    name of the color palette file. Must be present if you `want
    (1) <want.html>`_ mesh plot with contours (**-Qm**), `or
    (2) <or.2.html>`_ shaded/colored perspective image (**-Qs** or
    **-Qi**). For **-Qs**: You can specify that you want to skip a
    z-slice by setting red = -; to use a pattern give red =
    **P\|p**\ *dpi/pattern*\ [:**F**\ *color*\ [**B**\ *color*]].
    Alternatively, supply the name of a GMT color master CPT [rainbow] and let
    **grdview** automatically determine a 16-level continuous CPT from
    the gridâ€™s z-range.
**-G**\ *drapefile* \| **-G**\ *grd\_r*,\ *grd\_g*,\ *grd\_b*
    Drape the image in *drapefile* on top of the relief provided by
    *relief\_file*. [Default is *relief\_file*]. Note that **-Jz** and
    **-N** always refers to the *relief\_file*. The *drapefile* only
    provides the information pertaining to colors, which is looked-up
    via the cpt file (see **-C**). Alternatively, give three grid files
    separated by commas. These files must contain the red, green, and
    blue colors directly (in 0-255 range) and no cpt file is needed. The
    *drapefile* may be of higher resolution than the *relief\_file*.
**-I**\ *intensfile*\ \|\ *intensity*
    Gives the name of a grid file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range,
    or a constant intensity to apply everywhere.
    [Default is no illumination]. 

.. include:: explain_-K.rst_

**-N**\ *level*\ [/*color*]
    Draws a plane at this z-level. If the optional *color* is provided,
    the frontal facade between the plane and the data perimeter is
    colored. See **-Wf** for setting the pen used for the outline. 

.. include:: explain_-O.rst_

.. include:: explain_-P.rst_

**-Q**\ *type*\ [**g**\ ]
    Select one of four settings: 1. Specify **m** for mesh plot
    [Default], and optionally append /*color* for a different mesh paint
    [white]. 2. Specify **s** for surface plot, and optionally append
    **m** to have mesh lines drawn on top of surface. 3. Specify **i**
    for image plot, and optionally append the effective dpi resolution
    for the rasterization [100]. 4. Specify **c**. Same as **-Qi** but
    will make nodes with z = NaN transparent, using the colormasking
    feature in *PostScript* Level 3 (the PS device must support PS Level
    3). For any of these choices, you may force a monochrome image by
    appending **g**. Colors are then converted to shades of gray using
    the (television) YIQ transformation.

.. include:: explain_-R.rst_

.. |Add_-Rz| replace:: This option may be used to
    indicate the range used for the 3-D axes [Default is region given by
    the *relief\_file*]. You may ask for a larger *w/e/s/n* region to
    have more room between the image and the axes. A smaller region than
    specified in the *relief\_file* will result in a subset of the grid.
.. include:: explain_-Rz.rst_

**-S**\ *smooth*
    Smooth the contours before plotting (see **grdcontour**) [Default is
    no smoothing].
**-T**\ [**s**\ ][\ **o**\ [*pen*\ ]]
    Plot image without any interpolation. This involves converting each
    node-centered bin into a polygon which is then painted separately.
    Append **s** to skip nodes with z = NaN. This option is useful for
    categorical data where interpolating between values is meaningless.
    Optionally, append **o** to draw the tile outlines, and specify a
    custom pen if the default pen is not to your liking. As this option
    produces a flat surface it cannot be combined with **-JZ** or
    **-Jz**.

.. |Add_-V| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code

**-W**\ **type**\ *pen*

**-Wc**
    Draw contour lines on top of surface or mesh (not image). Append pen
    attributes used for the contours. [Default: width = 0.75p, color =
    black, style = solid].
**-Wm**
    Sets the pen attributes used for the mesh. [Default: width = 0.25p,
    color = black, style = solid]. You must also select **-Qm** or
    **-Qsm** for meshlines to be drawn.
**-Wf**
    Sets the pen attributes used for the facade. [Default: width =
    0.25p, color = black, style = solid]. You must also select **-N**
    for the facade outline to be drawn.

`Examples <#toc7>`_
-------------------

To make a mesh plot from the file hawaii\_grav.nc and drawing the
contours given in the color palette file hawaii.cpt on a Lambert map at
1.5 cm/degree along the standard parallels 18 and 24, with vertical
scale 20 mgal/cm, and looking at the surface from SW at 30 degree
elevation, run

    grdview hawaii\_grav.nc **-Jl**\ 18/24/1.5\ **c** -Chawaii.cpt
    **-Jz**\ 0.05\ **c** -Qm -N-100 -p225/30 -Wc > hawaii\_grav\_image.ps

To create a illuminated color perspective plot of the gridded data set
image.nc, using the color palette file color.rgb, with linear scaling at
10 cm/x-unit and tickmarks every 5 units, with intensities provided by
the file intens.nc, and looking from the SE, use

    grdview image.nc **-Jx**\ 10.0\ **c** -Ccolor.rgb -Qs -p135/30 -Iintens.nc > image3D.ps

To make the same plot using the rastering option with dpi = 50, use

    grdview image.nc **-Jx**\ 10.0\ **c** -Ccolor.rgb -Qi50 -p135/30 -Iintens.nc > image3D.ps

To create a color *PostScript* perspective plot of the gridded data set
magnetics.nc, using the color palette file mag\_intens.cpt, draped over
the relief given by the file topography.nc, with Mercator map width of 6
inch and tickmarks every 1 degree, with intensities provided by the file
topo\_intens.nc, and looking from the SE, run

    grdview topography.nc **-JM**\ 6\ **i** -Gmagnetics.nc -Cmag\_intens.cpt
    -Qs -p140/30 -Itopo\_intens.nc > draped3D.ps

Given topo.nc and the Landsat image veggies.ras, first run **grd2rgb**
to get the red, green, and blue grids, and then drape this image over
the topography and shade the result for good measure. The commands are

    grd2rgb veggies.ras -Glayer\_%c.nc

    grdview topo.nc **-JM**\ 6\ **i** -Qi -p140/30 -Itopo\_intens.nc
    -Glayer\_r.nc,layer\_g.nc,layer\_b.nc > image.ps

`Remarks <#toc8>`_
------------------

For the **-Qs** option: *PostScript* provides no way of smoothly varying
colors within a polygon, so colors can only vary from polygon to
polygon. To obtain smooth images this way you may resample the grid
file(s) using **grdsample** or use a finer grid size when running
gridding programs like **surface** or **nearneighbor**. Unfortunately,
this produces huge *PostScript* files. The alternative is to use the
**-Qi** option, which computes bilinear or bicubic continuous color
variations within polygons by using scanline conversion to image the
polygons.
