.SH NAME
sample1d \- Resampling of 1-D data sets
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsample1d\fP \fIinfile\fP [ OPT(Fl)|\fBa\fP|\fBc\fP|\fBn\fP ] [ GMT_H_OPT ] [ OPT(I)\fIxinc\fP ] 
[ OPT(N)\fIknotfile\fP ] [ OPT(S)\fIxstart\fP ] [ OPT(T)\fIx_col\fP] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ] [ GMT_b_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ] [ GMT_m_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsample1d\fP reads a multi-column ASCII [or binary] data set from file [or standard input] and interpolates the
timeseries/profile at locations where the user needs the values.  The user must provide
the column number of the independent (monotonically increasing \fBor\fP decreasing) variable.  Equidistant or arbitrary sampling can
be selected.  All columns are resampled based on the new sampling interval.
Several interpolation schemes are available.  Extrapolation outside the range of the input data is not supported.
.TP
\fIinfile\fP
This is a multi-column ASCII [of binary, see OPT(b)] file with one column containing the independent variable (which must
be monotonically in/de-creasing) and the remaining columns holding misc. data values.
If no file is provided, \fBsample1d\fP reads from standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(F)
Choose from \fBl\fP (Linear), \fBa\fP (Akima spline), \fBc\fP (natural cubic spline),
and \fBn\fP (no interpolation: nearest point) [Default is OPT(Fa)].
You may change the default interpolant; see \fBINTERPOLANT\fP in your \.gmtdefaults4 file.
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
OPT(I)
\fIxinc\fP defines the sampling interval. [Default is the separation between the first and
second abscissa point in the \fIinfile\fP]
.TP
OPT(N)
\fIknotfile\fP is an optional ASCII file with the x locations where the data set will be resampled in the first column.
Note: if OPT(H) is selected it applies to both \fIinfile\fP and \fIknotfile\fP.
.TP
OPT(S)
For equidistant sampling, \fIxstart\fP indicates the location of the first output value. [Default
is the smallest even multiple of \fIxinc\fP inside the range of \fIinfile\fP]
.TP
OPT(T)
Sets the column number of the independent variable [Default is 0 (first)].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 2 (or at least the number of columns implied by OPT(T))].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default is same as input].
#include "explain_-f.txt"
#include "explain_-m.txt"
#include "explain_precision.txt"
.SH CALENDAR TIME SAMPLING
If the abscissa are calendar times then you must use the OPT(f) option to indicate this.  Furthermore,
OPT(I) then expects an increment in the current \fBTIME_UNIT\fP units.  There is not yet support for
variable intervals such as months.
.SH EXAMPLES
To resample the file profiles.tdgmb, which contains (time,distance,gravity,magnetics,bathymetry) records,
at 1km equidistant intervals using Akima's spline, use\"'
.br
.sp
\fBsample1d\fP profiles.tdgmb OPT(I)1 OPT(Fa) OPT(T)1 > profiles_equi_d.tdgmb
.br
.sp
To resample the file depths.dt at positions listed in the file grav_pos.dg, using a cubic spline
for the interpolation, use
.br
.sp
\fBsample1d\fP depths.dt OPT(N)grav_pos.dg OPT(Fc) > new_depths.dt
