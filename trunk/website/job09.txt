Example 9.   A variety of data sets can be described as a time-series collected
along a track.  Examples are magnetic anomalies and seismic traces.  This illustration
shows deflections of the vertical along several sub-parallel Geosat tracks over some
south-Pacific fracture zones.  The program pswiggle plots the anomalies, while
psxy and pstext draw other features and anotates the plot.
