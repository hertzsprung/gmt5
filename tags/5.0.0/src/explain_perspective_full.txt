GMT_p_OPT
Selects perspective view and sets the azimuth and elevation of the viewpoint [180/90].
When OPT(p) is used in consort with OPT(Jz) or OPT(JZ), a third value can be appended which indicates
at which z-level all 2D material, like the plot frame, is plotted (in perspective). [Default is at the bottom of the z-axis].
Use OPT(px) or OPT(py) to plot against the "wall" x = level or y = level (default is at the bottom of the vertical
axis).
For frames used for animation, you may want to append BD(+) to fix the center
of your data domain (or specify a particular world coordinate point with BD(+w)IT(lon0)/IT(lat)[/IT(z)])
which will project to the center of your page size (or specify the coordinates
of the projected view point with BD(+v)IT(x0)/IT(y0).
When OPT(p) is used without any further arguments, the values from the last use of OPT(p) in a previous BD(GMT)
command will be used.
