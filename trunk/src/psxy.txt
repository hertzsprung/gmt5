.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpsxy\fP reads (x,y) pairs from \fIfiles\fP [or standard input] and
generates \fIPostScript\fP code that will plot lines, polygons, or symbols at those locations on a map.
If a symbol is selected and no symbol size given, then psxy will interpret the third column of the
input data as symbol size.  Symbols whose size is <= 0 are skipped.  If no symbols are specified then the symbol code (see \fB\-S\fP below)
must be present as last column in the input.  Multiple segment files may be plotted using the \fB\-M\fP option.
If \fB\-S\fP is not selected, a line connecting the data points will be drawn instead.  To 
explicitly close polygons, use \fB\-L\fP.  Select a shade with \fB\-G\fP.  If \fB\-G\fP is set, \fB\-W\fP
will control whether the polygon outline is drawn or not.  If a symbol is selected, \fB\-G\fP and
\fB\-W\fP determines the fill color and outline/no outline, respectively.
The \fIPostScript\fP code is written to standard output. 
.TP
\fIfiles\fP
List one or more file-names. If no files are given, \fBpsxy\fP will read standard input.
#include "explain_-j.txt"
#include "explain_-R.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-A
Suppress drawing line segments as great circle Arcs.  [Default draws great circle arcs.]
#include "explain_-b.txt"
.TP
.B \-C
Give a color palette file.  When used with -S, lets symbol color be determined by the z-value in the
third column.  Additional fields are
shifted over by one column (optional size would be 4th rather than 3rd field, etc.).
If -S is not set, psxy expects the user to supply a multisegment polygon file (requires -M) and will look
for -Z\fIval\fP strings in each multisegment header.  The \fIval\fP will control the color
via the cpt file.
.TP
.B \-E
Draw error bars.  Append \fBx\fP and/or \fBy\fP to indicate which bars you want to draw (Default is both x and y).  The x and/or
y errors must be stored in the columns after the (x,y) pair [or (x,y,size) triplet].  The
\fIcap\fP parameter indicates the length of the end-cap on the error bars [CAP_SI (or CAP_US)].  Pen
attributes for error bars may also be set.  [Defaults: width = 1, color = 0/0/0, texture = solid].  If upper case
\fBX\fP and/or \fBY\fP is used we will instead draw "box-and-whisker" (or "stem-and-leaf") symbols.  The x (or y)
coordinate is then taken as the median value, and 4 more columns are expected to contain the minimum (0% quartile), the 25%
quartile, the 75% quartile, and the maximum (100% quartile) values.  The 25-75% box may be filled by using \fB\-G\fP.
.TP
.B \-G
Select filling of polygons and symbols.
Append the shade (0\-255), color (r/g/b), or \fBP\fP|\fBp\fP\fIdpi\fP/\fIpattern\fP (polygons only) [Default is no fill].
Note when \fB\-M\fP is chosen, \fIpsxy\fP will search for \fB\-G\fP and \fB\-W\fP strings in all the subheaders and let any found values over-ride the command line settings.
#include "explain_-H.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Force closed polygons: connect the endpoints of the line-segment(s) and draw polygons.
.TP
.B \-M
Multiple segment file.  Segments are separated by a record whose first character is \fIflag\fP.
[Default is '>'].
.TP
.B \-N
Do NOT skip symbols that fall outside map border [Default plots points inside border only].
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-S
Plot symbols.  If present, \fIsize\fP is symbol size in the unit set in .gmtdefaults
(unless \fBc\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBm\fP, or \fBp\fP is appended).  The uppercase symbols
\fBA, C, D, H, I, S, T\fP are normalized to have the same area as the circle,
while the corresponding lowercase symbols all are circumscribed by the circle.
Choose between these symbol codes:
.TP
.B \-S
Read symbol code (see below) from last column in the input data.  Cannot be used in
conjunction with \fB\-b\fP.  Optionally, append \fBc\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBm\fP, \fBp\fP to
indicate that the size information in the input data is in units of cm, inch, meter,
or point, respectively. [Default is MEASURE_UNIT].
.TP
.B \-Sa
st\fBa\fPr.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
.B \-Sb
\fBb\fPar extending from \fIbase\fP to y.  \fIsize\fP is bar width. Append \fBu\fP
if \fIsize\fP is in x-units [Default is plot-distance units]. By default,
\fIbase\fP = 0.  Append \fBb\fP\fIbase\fP to change this value.  
.TP
.B \-Sc
\fBc\fPircle.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circle.
.TP
.B \-Sd
\fBd\fPiamond.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
.B \-Se
\fBe\fPllipse.  Direction (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), major_axis, and minor_axis must be found in columns 3, 4, and 5.
.TP
.B \-SE
Same as \fB\-Se\fP, except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (\fB\-Se\fP leaves the directions
unchanged.)  Furthermore, the axes lengths must be given in km instead of plot-distance units.
.TP
.B \-Sf
\fBf\fPront.  \fB\-Sf\fP\fIgap/size\fP[\fIdir\fP][\fItype\fP][:\fIoffset\fP].  Supply distance gap between symbols and symbol size.
If \fIgap\fP is negative, it is interpreted to mean the number of symbols along the front instead.  Append \fIdir\fP to plot symbols
on the \fBl\fPeft or \fBr\fPight side of the front [Default is centered].  Append \fItype\fP to specify which symbol
to plot: \fBb\fPox, \fBc\fPircle, \fBf\fPault, \fBs\fPlip, or \fBt\fPriangle.  [Default is fault].
Slip means left-lateral or right-lateral strike-slip arrows (centered is not an option).  Append :\fIoffset\fP to offset
the first symbol from the beginning of the front by that amount [Default is 0].
.TP
.B \-Sh
\fBh\fPexagon.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
.B \-Si
\fBi\fPnverted triangle.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
.B \-Sk
\fBk\fPustom symbol.  Append <name>/\fIsize\fP, and we will look for a definition file called
<name>.def in (1) the current directory or (2) in $GMTHOME/share/custom.  The symbol as defined
in that file is of size 1.0 by default; the appended \fIsize\fP will scale symbol accordingly.
Users may add their own custom *.def files using the rules in the GMT Reference and Cookbook, section
X.X.
.TP
.B \-Sl
\fBl\fPetter or text string (less than 64 characters).  Give size, and append /\fIstring\fP after the size.  Note that
the size is only approximate; no individual scaling
is done for different characters.  Remember to escape special characters like *.  Optionally, you may append %\fIfont\fP
to select a particular font [Default is ANOT_FONT].
.TP
.B \-Sp
\fBp\fPoint.  No size needs to be specified (1 pixel is used).
.TP
.B \-Ss
\fBs\fPquare.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
.B \-St
\fBt\fPriangle.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
.B \-Sv
\fBv\fPector.  Direction (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal) and length must be found in columns 3 and 4.  \fIsize\fP,
if present, will be interpreted as arrowwidth/headlength/headwidth [Default is PARAMS_SI (or PARAMS_US)].
By default arrow attributes remains invariant to the length
of the arrow.  To have the size of the vector scale down with decreasing size,
append \fBn\fP\fInorm\fP, where vectors shorter than \fInorm\fP will have their
attributes scaled by length/\fInorm\fP.  To center vector on point, use \fB\-Sv+\fP; to align point with the vector head,
use \fB\-Svh\fP; to align point with the vector tail, use \fB\-Svt\fP [Default].
.TP
.B \-SV
Same as \fB\-Sv\fP, except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (\fB\-Sv\fP leaves the directions
unchanged.)
.TP
.B \-Sw
pie \fBw\fPedge.  Start and stop directions (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal) for pie slice
must be found in columns 3 and 4.
.TP
.B \-Sx
cross.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circumscribing circle.
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"

.B \-W
Set pen attributes.  [Defaults: width = 1, color = 0/0/0, texture = solid].
Implicitly draws the outline of symbols with selected pen.

.SH BUGS
The \fB\-N\fP option does not adjust the BoundingBox information so you may
have to post-process the PostScript outout with epstool or ps2epsi to obtain
a correct BoundingBox.
.br
\fBpsxy\fP cannot handle filling of polygons that contain the south or north pole.  For such a polygon,
make a copy and split it into two and make each explicitly contain the polar point.  The two polygons
will combine to give the desired effect when filled; to draw outline use the original polygon.
