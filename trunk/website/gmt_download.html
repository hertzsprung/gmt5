<CENTER><H2>Availability of GMT source code</H2></CENTER>

GMT is available via anonymous ftp from several ftp servers; they
all contain the same files as the main server in Hawaii. Because of file
sizes you are strongly encouraged to use the server closest to you.
We distribute a Bourne shell script (install_gmt) that automatically will
get the required archives from the ftp site you choose.  For users
with a slow Internet-connection, Windows users preferring an InstallShield-based
solution, and users who desire large amounts
of supplemental data sets ready to be used with GMT: See the <B>GMT Companion CD-R and DVD-R</B>
products distributed by <A HREF="http://www.geoware-online.com" target="_blank"><B>Geoware</B></A>.

GMT, consider installing the "live" GMT version following the <A HREF="gmt_cvs.html">CVS Instructions</A>.</B>

Because of the size of the archives we suggest you verify that you have
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2" target="_blank">bzip2</A> on your system.
If not, it is worth installing (executables for most platforms are available)
since *.bz2 files are much smaller than *.gz files.  For instance, the
entire GMT package is ~50 Mb with bzip2 and 75 Mb with gzip.

<LI><I>Automated install [Recommended]</I>.
Obtain and install GMT by interacting with the <A HREF="gmt_install_form.html">INSTALL FORM</A>.
Follow instructions there to obtain the Bourne shell install-script <I>and</I> a customized install
parameter file.  The automated install will also install netCDF if needed.
<LI><I>Manual install</I>.
If you prefer, you can also do the typical manual install by ftping the files, untar,
run configure, make etc.  Read the README file for the required steps.
For manual install you must also manually get and install the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.gz">Unidata
netCDF library</A>, version 3.4 or higher, which GMT requries.
For your convenience, the netCDF source code is also available from the GMT ftp sites.

<LI><I>DOS batch files rule</I>.
If you just want to install WIndows executables and get on with it, visit our
<A HREF="gmt_windows.html">GMT Windows</A> page for access to Windows Installers.
Note that many of the DOS example scripts utilize GNU awk; the WIN32 executable
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/gawk303x.zip">gawk</A>
has therefore been placed on all ftp sites.
<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part I</I>.
Because you cannot get much done with DOS batch jobs, we strongly recommend that you install
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin" target="_blank">Cygwin</A>, a free UNIX emulation package for Windows.
Cygwin lets you open shell windows and access
standard UNIX tools such as tcsh, gcc, etc.  You would then install GMT as described above for UNIX/Linux.
<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part II</I>.
If you run Windows, you can get access to csh command windows by installing the freely available
Windows<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/interopmigration/unix/sfu" target="_blank"> Services for UNIX</A>, a UNIX environment
for Windows. SFU lets you install GMT as described for UNIX/Linux above.
<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part III</I>.
Finally, you may consider the option of purchasing and installing <A HREF="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMWare</A>, a virtual
computer which allows you to install numerous operating systems (such as Linux) and then pursue the
general Linux/UNIX install option above within your virtual machine.

GMT installs and runs under Mac OS X which is UNIX-based (follow instructions for
UNIX/Linux in 1.1).  You must have installed the Developer Tools (the GNU compiler,
etc; these are not installed by default but packages are available on the OS X Install DVD or
from Apple's support site). The latest versions of GMT are also available as user-friendly
<A HREF="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/gmt">packages</A>
via <A HREF="http://finkproject.org/" target="_blank">Fink</A>.

<LI> <B><IMG SRC="OS2.gif" WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="40">OS/2: </B>
GMT has been ported to OS/2.  For information and precompiled executables, see Allen Cogbill's
<A HREF="http://www.geopotential.com/gmt/gmt4os2.html" target="_blank">GMT OS/2 page</A>.

<CENTER><H2>Obtaining the old GMT 3.3.6 version</H2></CENTER>
If you for whatever reason need to install the final version of the GMT 3 series you must manually ftp the tar-balls from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt3">SOEST's GMT3 archive</A>, and run the installation (follow the steps in the README file).
