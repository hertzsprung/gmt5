Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce two new releases of GMT:

  * GMT 5.1.0  - The next generation of GMT
  * GMT 4.5.11 - The latest stable GMT 4 version

We also update the GSHHG geography data set to 2.2.4; this
release adds missing lakes to California and a few other fixes.

The change, improvements, and enhancements in GMT 5 are too
numerous for this short email; see our article published in EOS
on Tuesday, Nov. 5 via http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013EO450001.
Also, see the new documentation on http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu.
Please note that bug reports and feature requests should now be
posted via the website and not via email to all GMT users.

Note that users may choose to install both GMT versions and use
gmtswitch to switch between them as needed.  GMT 5 is backwards
compatible with GMT 4 via the new GMT_COMPATIBILITY=4 default
setting.

As of this announcement, the SOEST, NOAA, IRIS, Oslo, and Brazil
ftp servers have synced up; we expect the others will follow up
within 24 hours.  OS X users will find both gmt versions in fink,
with macports expected to follow shortly.  Linux users may have
to build from source until their package managers pick up the new
releases.  Windows installers are provided by us, as usual.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
