This installation does not include the man pages and the cookbook in PDF format,
only the html version. Furthermore, it does not include neither of the High 
or the Full resolution coastline files.  If you want to install any of those,
get the optional two installers

GMT_pdf_setup.exe
GMT_hfcoast_setup.exe 

Note: We didn't find a way to remove the path to gmt\bin from the PATH 
environmental variable (when this variable already existed). So if you do an
uninstall, you'll have to remove it manually.
