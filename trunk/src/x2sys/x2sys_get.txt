.SH NAME
x2sys_get \- Get track listing from track index databases
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_get\fP \fB\-T\fP\fITAG\fP [ \fB\-C\fP ] [ \fB\-F\fP\fIflags\fP ] 
[ \fB\-R\fIwest/east/south/north\fP ] [ \fB\-S\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] [ \fB\-X\fP[\fIlist\fP] ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_get\fP will return the track data files that match the given
requirements.  You may choose a geographic region and optionally ask
only for tracks that meet certain data criteria.  Finally, you may
select an option to list all possible pairs that might generate crossovers.
.TP
\fITAG\fP
The unique name of this data type system.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments
.TP
.B \-C
Instead of reporting the cruise ids, just output the coordinates of the
center of each bin that has at least one cruise with the specified data.
.TP
.B \-F
Give a comma-separated list of column names as defined in the definition
file. [Default is all data columns].
#include "explain_-R.txt"
.TP
.B \-S
Strip off the filename suffix when reporting.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-X
Crossover mode.  Return a list of cruise pairs that should be checked for possible
crossovers.  The list is determined from the bin index table on the assumption
that cruises occupying the same bin is very likely to intersect.  By default we
return all possible pairs in the data base.  Append the name of a file with a
list of cruises if you want the pair output to be limited to those that involve
at least one of the cruises in your list.  The output is suitable for the \fB\-K\fP
option in \fBx2sys_Cross\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
To find all the tracks associated with the tag MGD77, restricted to occupy
a certain region in the south Pacific, and have at least free air anomalies
and bathymetry, try
