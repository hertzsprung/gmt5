.SH GRID FILE FORMATS
BD(GMT) is able to recognize many of the commonly used grid file formats, as well as the precision, scale and offset of the values
contained in the grid file. When BD(GMT) needs a little help with that, you can add the suffix GMT_GRD_SUFFIX,
where IT(id) is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and precision, and IT(scale) and IT(offset) are optional scale factor
and offset to be applied to all grid values, and IT(nan) is the value used to indicate missing data.
See BD(grdreformat)(1) and Section 4.17 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information.
.P
When reading a netCDF file that contains multiple grids, BD(GMT) will read, by default, the first 2-dimensional grid that can find in that
file. To coax BD(GMT) into reading another multi-dimensional variable in the grid file, append BD(?)IT(varname) to the file name, where
IT(varname) is the name of the variable. Note that you may need to escape the special meaning of BD(?) in your shell program
by putting a backslash in front of it, or by placing the filename and suffix between quotes or double quotes.
See BD(grdreformat)(1) and Section 4.18 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information,
particularly on how to read splices of 3-, 4-, or 5-dimensional grids.
