Example 12.   This figure shows the results of optimal (Delaunay) triangulation on
a data sets with uniformly distributed (x,y,z) values.  GMT allows for direct
contouring and imaging of the raw data by way of triangulation.  Here, the program
triangulate found the optimal triangle configuration, psxy drew the lines,
pxtext took care of annotations, and pscontour colored the triangulations directly.
