.SH NAME
trend1d \- Fit a [weighted] [robust] polynomial [or Fourier] model for y = f(x) to xy[w] data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(trend1d) [ IT(datatables) ] OPT(F)BD(xymrw|p) OPT(N)[BD(f)]IT(n_model)[BD(r)] [ IT(xy[w]file) ] 
[ OPT(C)IT(condition_number) ] [ OPT(I)[IT(confidence_level)] ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] 
[ OPT(W) ] [ GMT_b_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ] [ GMT_h_OPT ] [ GMT_i_OPT ] [ GMT_colon_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(trend1d) reads x,y [and w] values from the first two [three] columns on standard input 
[or IT(file)] and fits a regression model y = f(x) + e by [weighted] least squares.  The
functional form of f(x) may be chosen as polynomial or Fourier, and the fit may be made robust by 
iterative reweighting of the data.  The user may also search for the number of terms in f(x) which 
significantly reduce the variance in y.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(F)BD(xymrw|p)
Specify up to five letters from the set {BD(x y m r w)} in any order to create columns of 
ASCII [or binary] output.  BD(x) = x, BD(y) = y, BD(m) = model f(x), BD(r) = residual y - BD(m), BD(w) = weight used in fitting.
Alternatively choose OPT(F)BD(p) (i.e. no other of the 5 letters) to output only the model coefficients (Polynomial).
.TP
OPT(N)[BD(f)]IT(n_model)[BD(r)]
Specify the number of terms in the model, IT(n_model), whether to fit 
a Fourier (OPT(Nf)) or polynomial [Default] model, and append BD(r) to do a robust fit.  E.g., a robust 
quadratic model is OPT(N)IT(3)BD(r).
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(datatables)
One or more ASCII [or binary, see GMT_bi_OPT] files containing x,y [w] values in the first 2 [3] columns.  
If no files are specified, BD(trend1d) will read from standard input.
.TP
OPT(C)IT(condition_number)
Set the maximum allowed condition number for the matrix solution.  BD(trend1d) 
fits a damped least squares model, retaining only that part of the eigenvalue spectrum such that 
the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue is IT(condition_#).   
[Default:  IT(condition_#) = 1.0e06. ].
.TP
OPT(I)[IT(confidence_level)]
Iteratively increase the number of model parameters, starting at one, until 
IT(n_model) is reached or the reduction in variance of the model is not significant at the 
IT(confidence_level) level.  You may set OPT(I) only, without an attached number; in this 
case the fit will be iterative with a default confidence level of 0.51.  Or choose your own level 
between 0 and 1.  See remarks section.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)
Weights are supplied in input column 3.  Do a weighted least squares fit [or start with these weights 
when doing the iterative robust fit].  [Default reads only the first 2 columns.]
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 2 (or 3 if OPT(W) is set) columns].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default is 1-5 columns as given by OPT(F)].

.SH REMARKS
If a Fourier model is selected, the domain of x will be shifted and scaled to [-pi, pi] and the basis functions 
used will be 1, cos(x), sin(x), cos(2x), sin(2x), ...   If a polynomial model is selected, the domain of x 
will be shifted and scaled to [-1, 1] and the basis functions will be Chebyshev polynomials.  These have a 
numerical advantage in the form of the matrix which must be inverted and allow more accurate solutions.  
The Chebyshev polynomial of degree n has n+1 extrema in [-1, 1], at all of which its value is either -1 
or +1.  Therefore the magnitude of the polynomial model coefficients can be directly compared.  NOTE: 
The stable model coefficients are Chebyshev coefficients.  The corresponding polynomial coefficients in
a + bx + cxx + ...  are also given in Verbose mode but users must realize that they are NOT stable beyond
degree 7 or 8. See Numerical Recipes for more discussion.  For evaluating Chebyshev polynomials,
see BD(gmtmath).
.sp
The OPT(Nr) (robust) and OPT(I) (iterative) options evaluate the significance of the improvement 
in model misfit Chi-Squared by an F test.  The default confidence limit is set at 0.51; it can be changed 
with the OPT(I) option.  The user may be surprised to find that in most cases the reduction in variance 
achieved by increasing the number of terms in a model is not significant at a very high degree of 
confidence.  For example, with 120 degrees of freedom, Chi-Squared must decrease by 26% or more to be significant 
at the 95% confidence level.  If you want to keep iterating as long as Chi-Squared is decreasing, set 
IT(confidence_level) to zero.
.sp
A low confidence limit (such as the default value of 0.51) is needed to make the robust method 
work.  This method iteratively reweights the data to reduce the influence of outliers.  The 
weight is based on the Median Absolute Deviation and a formula from Huber [1964], and is 95% 
efficient when the model residuals have an outlier-free normal distribution.  This means that the 
influence of outliers is reduced only slightly at each iteration; consequently the reduction in 
Chi-Squared is not very significant.  If the procedure needs a few iterations to successfully 
attenuate their effect, the significance level of the F test must be kept low.
.SH EXAMPLES
To remove a linear trend from data.xy by ordinary least squares, use:  
.sp
trend1d data.xy -Fxr -N2 > detrended_data.xy 
.sp
To make the above linear trend robust with respect to outliers, use:
.sp
trend1d data.xy -Fxr -N2r > detrended_data.xy 
.sp
To find out how many terms (up to 20, say in a robust Fourier interpolant are significant in fitting data.xy, use:
.sp
trend1d data.xy -Nf20r -I -V
