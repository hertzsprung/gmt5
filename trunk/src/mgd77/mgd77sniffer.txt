.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmgd77sniffer\fP scans old (pre-Y2K) and new format MGD77 files for errors using point-by-point
sanity checking, along-track detection of excessive slopes, and optional comparison of
cruise data with global gravity and predicted bathymetry grids. Detected data problems are output
by default as verbose descriptions of each detected error, often resulting in multiple messages per 
scanned record. Data problems are optionally output (-De option) using a computer-parseable format
(see E77 ERROR FORMAT description below). Default error thresholds are derived from histograms of
all MGD77 geophysical data collected between 1952 and January, 2006. Thresholds are adjustable with
the -O option.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
The mgd77sniffer links with Generic Mapping Tools 4.0 or later along with the supplemental GMT
packages x2sys and mgd77. See http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu for GMT details. Grids for comparison with
cruise data may be downloaded via the web. Among the many useful grids are NOAA's ETOPO2 global
topography grid available from the National Geophysical Data Center's website as well as Sandwell
and Smith's Raw Gravity grid available from Scripps Institution of Oceanography's website.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Apply scale factor and DC adjustment to specified data field. Allows adjustment of cruise data prior
to along-track analysis. CAUTION: data must be thoroughly examined before applying these global data
adjustments. May not be used for multiple cruises.
.TP
.B \-C
Set maximum ship speed in m/s, or knots with \fB\-N\fP option. Ship speeds exceeding 10 m/s (~20 knots)
are flagged as excessive by default.
.TP
.B \-D
Suppress default warning output and only dump cruise data row-by-row such as values, gradients,
grid-cruise differences, E77 error summaries for each record, re-created MGD77 records
or sniffer limits.
.br
.sp
\fB\-Dd\fP
output differences between cruise and grid data. Requires \fB\-G\fP option. Output columns include: 
.br
.sp
\fIlat lon dist cruiseZ gridZ diff [cruiseZ2 gridZ2 diff2 ...]\fP
.br
.sp
Note: grid values are subtracted from cruise data so a positive difference implies cruise > grid.
For multiple grid comparison, \fIcruiseZ gridZ diff\fP are repeated for each grid comparison in command line order.
.br
.sp
\fB\-De\fP
output E77 error classification format. Error output is divided into (1) a header containing
information globally applicable to the cruise and (2) individual error records summarizing all
errors encountered in each cruise record. One error record is output for each readable cruise record.
mgd77sniffer writes E77 directly to <ngdc_id.e77> file handle. See \fBE77 ERROR FORMAT\fP below
for additional details.
.br
.sp
\fB\-Df\fP
output delta Z (change in geophysical field) column and delta S (change in distance) for each
geophysical field. Distance between observations often differ for different fields depending
on instrument sampling rate, so ds is included for each geophysical observation. Output
columns include: 
.br
.sp
\fId[twt] ds d[depth] ds d[mtf1] ds d[mtf2] ds d[mag] ds d[diur] ds d[msd] ds d[gobs] ds d[eot] ds d[faa] ds\fP
.br
.sp
\fB\-Dl\fP
display mgd77sniffer limits. Customize this output to create a custom limits file for 
the \fB\-O\fP option. No additional arguments are required. Output columns include:
.br
.sp
\fIfieldabbrev min max maxSlope maxArea\fP
.br
.sp
\fB\-Dm\fP
output MGD77 format records in Y2K-compliant MGD77 format
.br
.sp
\fB\-Ds\fP
output calculated gradients for speed and geophysical fields. Gradients correspond to the gradient type
selected in the \fB\-S\fP option (spatial derivatives by default). Output columns include:
.br
.sp
\fIspeed d[twt] d[depth] d[mtf1] d[mtf2] d[mag] d[diur] d[msd] d[gobs] d[eot] d[faa]\fP
.br
.sp
See \fBMGD77 FIELD INFO\fP below for field and abbreviations descriptions.
.br
.sp
\fB\-Dv\fP
display values for the twelve position and geophysical fields for each MGD77 data record (in this order):
.br
.sp
\fIlat lon twt depth mtf1 mtf2 mag diur msens gobs eot faa\fP
.br
.sp
See below for \fBMGD77 FIELD INFO\fP.
.TP
.B \-g
Compare cruise data to the specified grid in Sandwell/Smith Mercator format. Requires a valid MGD77 field abbreviation (see 
\fBMGD77 FIELD INFO\fP below) followed by a comma, the path (if not in current directory)
and grid filename, a scale to multiply the data (1 or 0.1), and mode which stand for the following:
(0) Img files with no constraint code, returns data at all points, (1) Img file with constraints coded,
return data at all points, (2) Img file with constraints coded, return data only at constrained points
and NaN elsewhere, and (3) Img file with constraints coded, return 1 at constraints and 0 elsewhere.
.TP
.B \-G
Compare cruise data to the specified grid. Requires a valid MGD77 field abbreviation (see 
\fBMGD77 FIELD INFO\fP below) followed by a comma, then the path (if not in current directory)
and grid filename. Multiple grid comparison is supported by using separate \fB\-g\fP or \fB\-G\fP calls for each 
grid. See \fBGRID FILE INFO\fP below.
.br
.sp
Grid comparison activates several additional error checks. (1) Re-weighted Least Squares 
Regression of ship versus grid data determines slope and DC shift, which when differing
from expected 1 and 0, respectively, may indicate incorrectly scaled ship data, including
incorrect units or instrument drift as well as erroneous gravity tie-in. (2) Accumulated ship
grid offsets are computed along-track and excessive offsets are flagged according to \fImaxArea\fP
threshold (use \fB\-O\fP option to adjust \fImaxArea\fP). Warning: predicted bathymetry grids are
constrained by cruise data so grids and cruise data are not always independent. Comparison of
cruise bathymetry with predicted bathymetry grids also activates a "navigation crossing over land"
check.
.br
.sp
.TP
.B \-H
(with -G|g only) disable data decimation during RLS regression.
.TP
.B \-N
Use nautical units.
.TP
.B \-O
Override mgd77sniffer default error detection limits. Supply path and filename to
the custom limits file. Rows not beginning with a valid MGD77 field abbreviation are
ignored. Field abbreviations are listed below in exact form under MGD77 FIELD INFO.
Multiple field limits may be modified using one default file, one field per line.
Field min, max, max slope and max area may be changed for each field. Max slope
pertains to the gradient type selected using the \fB\-S\fP option. Max area is used by the
\fB\-G\fP option as the threshold for flagging excessive offsets from the specified grid.
Dump defaults (\fB\-Dl\fP) to view syntax or to quickly create an editable custom limits file.
.br
.sp
Example custom default file contents (see below for units):
.br
\('## abbrev min     max     maxSlope    maxArea
.br

.TP

.br
\fB\-Sd\fP
Calculate change in z values along track (dz). Output is given in geophysical units,
e.g. mGal.

Calculate spatial gradients (dz/ds). Output is given in geophysical units per km along the
survey track, e.g. mGal/km.

per second along the survey track, e.g. mGal/sec.
.TP
.B \-T
Adjusts mgd77sniffer gap handling. By default, data gaps greater than 5 km are skipped. Set to
zero to de-activate gap skipping.
.TP

\fBc|g|o|s|t|v|x\fP: where (\fBc\fP) type code warnings, (\fBg\fP)radient out of range, (\fBo\fP)ffsets
from grid (requires \fB\-G|g\fP), (\fBs\fP)peed out of range, (\fBt\fP)ime warnings, (\fBv\fP)alue out of

.SH GRID FILE INFO
For \fB\-g\fP the grids must be in the format used by Sandwell & Smith, which is a spherical Mercator 2-byte grid with no header.
For \fB\-G\fP the grid files can be of any grid type supported by GMT and therefore must contain a GMT header. 
A correctly formatted *.i2 grid file can be generated using grdraster as shown below.
.br
.sp
gmtset GRIDFILE_SHORTHAND TRUE
.br
.sp
Create/edit .gmt_io file to include the following rows:
.br
\('## GMT I/O shorthand file
.br
\('## suffix   format_id scale offset       NaN
.br

.br
.sp
grdraster 1 -R0/359:55/-90/90 -Getopo5_hdr.i2
.br
.sp
The new grid, etopo5_hdr.i2 in this example, contains a GMT header and can be used in
the \fB\-G\fP option to compare cruise depth with grid values.

\fBHeader\fP
Information pertaining to an entire cruise, such as NGDC and survey institution identification codes,
cruise examination time, two-way travel time corrector information, data precision warnings, as well as 
systematic scales, DC shifts and correlation coefficients from global grid comparisons are reported as
E77 header information.
