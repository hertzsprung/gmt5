OPT(n)
Select the interpolation mode by adding \fBb\fP for B-spline smoothing,
\fBc\fP for bicubic interpolation, \fBl\fP for bilinear interpolation, or
\fBn\fP for nearest-neighbor value (for example to plot categorical data).
Optionally, prepend \fB-\fP to switch off antialiasing.
Add \fB/\fP\fIthreshold\fP to control how close to nodes with NaNs the interpolation will go.
A \fIthreshold\fP of 1.0 requires all (4 or 16) nodes involved in interpolation
to be non-NaN. 0.5 will interpolate about half way from a non-NaN value; 0.1 will go about 90% of the way, etc.
[Default is bicubic interpolation with antialiasing and a threshold of 0.5].
