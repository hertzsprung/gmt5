Description
-----------

**psimage** reads an Encapsulated PostScript file or a raster image
file and plots it on a map. The image can be scaled arbitrarily, and
1-bit raster images can be (1) inverted, i.e., black
pixels (on) becomes white (off) and vice versa, or
(2) colorized, by assigning different foreground and
background colors, and (3) made transparent where one of
back- or foreground is painted only. As an option, the user may choose
to convert colored raster images to grayscale using TV's
YIQ-transformation. For raster files, the user can select which color to
be made transparent. The user may also choose to replicate the image
which, when preceded by appropriate clip paths, may allow larger
custom-designed fill patterns to be implemented (the **-Gp** mechanism
offered in most GMT programs is limited to rasters smaller than 146
by 146). 

Required Arguments
------------------

*imagefile*
    This must be an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file or a raster
    image. An EPS file must contain an appropriate BoundingBox. A raster
    file can have a depth of 1, 8, 24, or 32 bits and is read via GDAL.
    If GDAL was not configured during GMT installation then only
    Sun raster files are supported natively.
**-E**\ *dpi*
    Sets the dpi of the image in dots per inch, or use **-W**.
**-W**\ [**-**]\ *width*\ [/*height*]
    Sets the width (and height) of the image in plot coordinates
    (inches, cm, etc.). If *height* is not given, the original aspect
    ratio of the image is maintained. If *width* is negative we use the
    absolute value and interpolate image to the device resolution using
    the PostScript image operator. Alternatively, use **-E**.

Optional Arguments
------------------

**-C**\ *xpos*/*ypos*\ [/*justify*]
    Sets position of the image in plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.)
    from the current origin of the plot. By default, this defines the
    position of the lower left corner of the image, but this can be
    changed by specifying justification [0/0/BL].
**-F**\ *pen*
    Draws a rectangular frame around the image with the given pen [no
    frame].

.. include:: explain_-Jz.rst_

.. include:: explain_-K.rst_

**-M**
    Convert color image to monochrome grayshades using the (television)
    YIQ-transformation.
**-N**\ *nx*\ [/*ny*]
    Replicate the image *nx* times horizontally and *ny* times
    vertically. If *ny* is omitted, it will be identical to *nx*
    [Default is 1/1].

These options are for 1-bit images only. They have no effect when
plotting other images or PostScript files.

**-G**\ [**b**\ \|\ **f**\ \|\ **t**]\ *color*
    **-Gb**
        Sets background color (replace white pixel) of 1-bit images. Use -
        for transparency (and set **-Gf** to the desired color).
    **-Gf**
        Sets foreground color (replace black pixel) of 1-bit images. Use -
        for transparency (and set **-Gb** to the desired color).
    **-I**
        Invert 1-bit image before plotting. This is what is done when you
        use **-GP** in other GMT programs.

These options are for 8-, 24-, and 32-bit raster images only. They have
no effect when plotting 1-bit images or PostScript files.

**-Gt**
    Assigns the color that is to be made transparent. Sun Raster files
    do not support transparency, so indicate here which color to be made
    transparent.

Examples
--------

To plot the image contained in the 8-bit raster file scanned_face.ras,
scaling it to 8 by 10 cm (thereby possibly changing the aspect ratio),
and making the white color transparent, use

   ::

    gmt psimage scanned_face.ras -W8c/10c -Gtwhite > image.ps

To plot the image logo.jpg, scaling it be 1 inch wide (height is scaled
accordingly), and outline with a thin, blue pen, use

   ::

    gmt psimage logo.jpg -W1i -Fthin,blue > image.ps

To include an Encapsulated PostScript file tiger.eps with its upper
right corner 2 inch to the right and 1 inch up from the current
location, and have its width scaled to 3 inches, while keeping the
aspect ratio, use

   ::

    gmt psimage tiger.eps -C2i/1i/TR -W3i > image.ps

To replicate the 1-bit raster image template 1_bit.ras, colorize it
(brown background and red foreground), and setting each of 5 by 5 tiles
to be 1 cm wide, use

   ::

    gmt psimage 1_bit.ras -Gbbrown -Gfred -N5 -W1c > image.ps
