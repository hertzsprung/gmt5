.SH NAME
sphinterpolate \- Gridding in tension of spherical data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsphinterpolate\fP \fIinfiles\fP OPT(G)\fIgrdfile\fP [ OPT(F) ] [ GMT_H_OPT ] [ GMT_I_OPT ] 
[ OPT(L) ] [ GMT_M_OPT ] [ OPT(T)\fItension\fP ] [ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] [ GMT_t_OPT ] [ GMT_b_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsphinterpolate\fP reads one or more ASCII [or binary] files (or standard input) containing lon, lat, f and
performs a Delaunay triangulation to set up a spherical interpolation in tension.  The final grid is saved
to the specified file.  Several options may be used to affect the outcome, such as choosing local versus global gradient
estimation or optimize the tension selection to satisfy one of four criteria.
.TP
\fIinfiles\fP
Data files with the (lon, lat, f) coordinates in ASCII (or binary; see \fB\-b\fP).  If no files are given the standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
#include "explain_-H.txt"
#include "explain_-I.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Use a local method, in which values depend only on nearby data points, to compute
estimated gradients at the nodes [Default uses a global method in which values depend on all the data].
.TP
.B \-M
Expect input data to have multiple line segments separated by a record whose first
character is \fIflag\fP [>].
.TP
.B \-T
Specify one of four ways to calculate tension factors to preserve local shape properties or
satisfy arc constraints [Default is no tension].
.TP
.B \-Ts
Determine, for each triangulation arc, the smallest (nonnegative) tension factor such that the
Hermite interpolatory tension spline, defined by the tension and the specified endpoint data,
preserves local shape properties (monotonicity and convexity) of the data.
.TP
.B \-Tv
Determine the smallest tension factor such that the
Hermite interpolatory tension spline associated with a specified triangulation arc and endpoint data
is bounded (either above of below) by a specified value.
.TP
.B \-Tg
Determine the smallest tension factor such that the first derivative of the
Hermite interpolatory tension spline associated with a specified triangulation arc and endpoint data
is bounded (either above of below) by a specified value.
.TP
.B \-Tc
Determine the smallest tension factor such that the
Hermite interpolatory tension spline associated with a specified triangulation arc and endpoint data
preserves convexity (or concavity) of the data on the arc.
