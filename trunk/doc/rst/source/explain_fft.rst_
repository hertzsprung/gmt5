    Choose or inquire about suitable grid dimensions for FFT and set
    optional parameters.
    Control the FFT dimension:
    **-Nf** will force the FFT to use the actual
    dimensions of the data. **-Nq** will inQuire about more suitable
    dimensions, report those, then continue. **-Ns** will present a list
    of optional dimensions, then exit. **-N**\ *nx/ny* will do FFT on
    array size *nx/ny* (must be >= grid file size). Default chooses
    dimensions >= data which optimize speed and accuracy of FFT. If FFT
    dimensions > grid file dimensions, data are extended and tapered to
    zero.
    Control detrending of data:
    Append modifiers for removing a linear trend:
    **+d**: Detrend data, i.e. remove best-fitting linear trend [Default].
    **+a**: Only remove mean value, i.e. 0.5 * (max + min).
    **+h**: Only remove mid value, i.e. 0.5 * (max + min).
    **+l**: Leave data alone.
    Control extension and tapering of data:
    Use modifiers to control how the extension and tapering are to
    be performed: **+e** extends the grid by imposing edge-point
    symmetry [Default], **+m** extends the grid by imposing edge mirror
    symmetry, while **+n** turns off data extension. Tapering is
    performed from the data edge to the FFT grid edge [100%]. Change
    this percentage via **+t**\ *width*. When **+n** is in effect, the
    tapering is applied instead to the data margins as no extension is
    available [0%].
    Control writing of temporary results:
    For detailed investigation you can write the
    intermediate grid being passed to the forward FFT; this is likely to
    have been detrended, extended by point-symmetry along all edges, and
    tapered. Append **+w**\ [*suffix*\ ] from which output file name(s)
    will be created (i.e., *ingrid_prefix.ext*)
    [tapered], where *ext* is your file extension. Finally, you may save
    the complex grid produced by the forward FFT by appending **+z**. By
    default we write the real and imaginary components to
    *ingrid*\ \_*real* *ext* and *ingrid*\ \_imag.\ *ext*. Append
    **p** to save instead the polar form of magnitude and phase to files
    *ingrid*\ \_mag.\ *ext* and *ingrid*\ \_phase.\ *ext*.
