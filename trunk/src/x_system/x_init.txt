.SH NAME
\fBx_init\fP \- Initialization of Cross-Over Data Bases.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx_init\fP OPT(I)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of \fBx_init\fP is to create two key files that will be holding all the cross-over
information for all the cruises tested. These files are called \fIxx_base.b\fP and \fIxx_legs.b\fP, and
they will contain data for each cross-over and totals for each leg, respectively. 
\fBx_init\fP will create these two files in the current directory, and write out the
fileheader with a 1 as the next record number in the case of xx_base.b. NB! Any previous files
with the same names in the current directory will be erased, so use with caution.
.TP
OPT(I)
Must be present form initialization to take effect.
.SH BEWARE
Both files are binary and have fixed record lengths. The formats of the files are as follows:
.br
.TP
.B xx_base.b:
	Record length = 40 bytes.
.br
	Rec # 1:		fileheader
.br
	Rec # 2:		pairheader
.br
	Next n recs:		crossover-structure
.br
	Rec  #  n+3:		pairheader etc.
.br
The fileheader is a 40 byte character string where the last 10 bytes contains the record number of
the last record in the file.
The pairheader is a 40 byte character string which contains the names of the two legs in question
and the number of COEs generated between them.
The crossover-structure contains all the information for one COE, that is lat, lon, time along leg
values of gravity, magnetics, and bathymetry at the cross-over point, the heading of track #1,
and the heading of track #2. See program listing for more details on formats. The file is
sequential in that new data are appended at the end of the file.
.TP
.B xx_legs.b:
	Record length = 204 bytes.
.br
.sp
Each record contains the complete information for each leg that has been checked. The
leg-structure contains fields like year of cruise, number of internal/external COEs for gravity,
magnetics, and bathymetry, their means and standard deviations, and the best fitting regression
lines, i.e. the dc-shifts and drift-rates computed from the time/error data points. See program
listing for complete description of record format.
