Various demonstrations of how to use the API, including templates for programs that need
to perform typical operations like:

1. Basic input/output
2. Visiting nodes in grids and records in tables
3. Using the FFT machinery

For now I am imagining that these developers have installed GMT5 and just wish to use
the API in their code. I assume they can just use the example configure.ac, config.mk.in
and Makefile to do their development.  However, we may consider providing a cmake
template for a GMT User Supplement.
