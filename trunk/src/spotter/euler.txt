.TP
.B \-E
Give file with rotation poles and opening angles.  This file must contain
one record for each rotation; each record must be of the following format:
.br
.sp
	\fIlon lat tstart [tstop] ccw-angle\fP [ \fIkhat a b c d e f g df\fP ]
.br
.sp
where \fItstart\fP and \fItstop\fP are in Ma and \fIlon lat ccw-angle\fP are
in degrees.  For state rotations the oldest stage must be listed first.  \fItstart\fP (\fItstop\fP)
is the age of the old (young) end of a stage.  If OPT(C) is set then a total
reconstruction rotation is expected and \fItstop\fP is implicitly set to 0 and
should not be in the file.  If a covariance matrix \fBC\fP for the rotation is available
it must be specified in a format using the nine optional terms listed in brackets.
Here, \fBC\fP = (\fIg\fP/\fIkhat\fP)*[ \fIa b d; b c e; d e f\fP ] which shows \fBC\fP
made up of three row vectors.
If the degrees of freedom (\fIdf\fP) is not listed it is set to 1000.
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.

Alternatively, specify the longitude, latitude, and opening angle (all in degrees
and separated by /) for a single total reconstruction
rotation that should be applied to all input points.
