Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.5.4.
This release mostly fixes several bugs. At the same time,
we are making available, via cvs access, the alpha version of
next GMT 5 release.  For more information on GMT 5 and who should
consider trying it out, see gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/5.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

As of today, all but the Japan, European (2), and S Africa mirror
ftp servers are now synced up; we hope those four will follow
within 24 hours.  Alternatively, OS X users will find GMT 4.5.4
in Fink's 'unstable' tree.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
