Dear GMT user-

We need to announce the release of GMT version 4.3.1.
This release fixes three critical (and persistent) bugs
in GMT as well as a few minor problems and is a recommended
upgrade from the recently released GMT 4.3.0.  Note that
there is no change to GSHHS which still is version 1.10.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).


Sincerely,

Paul Wessel
Walter H. F. Smith
The GMT Team
