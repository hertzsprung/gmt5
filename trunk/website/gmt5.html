<H3>GMT 5 Overview</H3>

GMT 5 is the next-generation version of GMT, the Generic Mapping Tools.  It is currently still in
development but stable enough that some users and developers may wish to join in testing and influencing
the direction we are moving in.  We anticipate GMT 5 will remain in this phase (alpha) until early
2011 when we expect to release a formal GMT 5.0.0beta release (with tar balls and Windows installers).
The first stable release GMT 5.0.0 may appear later in 2011.
<H3>What it means for users</H3>
For regular users, GMT 5 will not seem too different from GMT 4.  While there have been some minor
syntax changes, including elimination of the <B>-m</B> (or <B>-M</B> as some of you still are using) option, and
a renaming of several of the GMT defaults parameters, we also allow for a compatibility-mode
compilation that will let most GMT 4-style scripts run without problems.  In fact, most users will
simply notice that there are a few more tools and a few more options, as well as some significant
system-level changes.  The highlights are of major features are:
<UL>
	<LI>GMT now has a way of dealing with GIS aspatial data, such as produced by ogr2ogr -f"GMT" from
		shapefiles and other GIS formats.  The metadata can be used to set certain program arguments,
		such as symbol sizes or labels. The program gmtconvert can also covert plain GMT tables into
		the GMT/OGR format that ogr2ogr may translate into shapefiles and other GIS formats.
		Furthermore, the ESRI Arc/Info ASCII Grid Interchange format is now a recognized grid format.
	<LI>All GMT program that reads data tables can control how records with NaNs are handled with a
		new <B>-s</B> option.
	<LI>GMT now has new capabilities for handling PDF transparency.
		All color or fill specifications in GMT (including fonts and CPT tables) may append @<I>transparency</I>
		to change the PDF transparency level for that item.  In addition, all plot programs can take
		a new <B>-t</B> option to modify the PDF transparency level for the entire overlay.
		However, as <I>PostScript</I> has no provision for transparency you can only see these effect if
		you convert it to PDF using Adobe Distiller.  To date, none of the GhostScript products has
		implemented this <I>PostScript</I> extension.
	<LI>Our macro language for custom plot symbols (to use in psxy and psxyz) has been extended to
		allow for multi-parameter symbols.
	<LI>All GMT programs that process table data can handle multi-segment files without any special options.
		[In the passed this required <B>-m</B> and some programs did not even have the option].
	<LI>All GMT plot programs that produce 2-D illustrations now take a new <B>-p</B> option for perspective
		view.  This replaces the old way of using <B>-E</B><I>az/el</I>.
	<LI>All text can now optionally be filled with patterns and/or drawn with outline pens by appending =<I>pen</I>
		to the font color [In GMT 4, only pstext could draw an outline pen, but fill could only be solid colors].
	<LI>There will be some new supplements: <B>potential</B> for gravity and magnetics calculations,
		<B>isostasy</B> for plate flexure calculations, and hopefully <B>spharmonics</B> for converting between
		global grids and spherical harmonics coefficients.
</UL>
<H3>What it means for developers</H3>
The big news is for developers who wish to leverage GMT in their own applications.  We have completely revamped
the code base so that high-level GMT functionality is now accessible via GMT "modules".  These are high-level
functions named after their corresponding programs (.e.g., GMT_grdimage) that contains all of the functionality
of that program within the function.  While currently callable from C/C++ only, we have built several of the
Matlab interface modules as well and will soon start on the Python version.  Developers should consult the new
GMT API Documentation for more details, and examine the demonstration application gmtmapper.c.<BR>
	We have also redesigned the <I>PostScript</I> plotting library pslib; it is now referred to as PSL and
has seen much simplification and under-the-hood improvements.  All functions have been renamed so those who
have used PSL directly in the past will need to consult the documentation.

<H3>GMT 5 Installation</H3>
GMT 5 will only be available via cvs until it is officially released.  Because GMT 5 is expected to still have
too many short-comings or bugs to be used for production, you will need to become familiar with the gmtswitch
tool that lets you seamlessly switch between different GMT versions.
To install GMT 5, cd to your GMTdev directory (where we recommend you may have other GMT distributions
such as 4.5.4 and GMT 4 cvs) and run<P>
	cvs checkout -d GMT5 -r GMT5_branch<P>
You will then get the GMT 5 branch installed in a GMT5 directory.  Like for GMT 4 cvs you will need to
make a few changes perhaps to the guru/gmtguru.macros file and to copy over coastlines, e.g.,<P>
make get_coast get_high get_full<P>
You can then issue make install.  Once you add the full path to the GMT5 directory to your
~/.gmtversions file you can use gmtswitch to go between versions.
