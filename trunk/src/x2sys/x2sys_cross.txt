.SH NAME
\fBx2sys_cross\fP \- Find and compute crossover errors
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_cross\fP \fItrack(s)\fP OPT(T)\fITAG\fP 
[ OPT(F)\fIflags\fP ] [ OPT(Il)|\fBa\fP|\fBc\fP ] 
[ GMT_J_OPT ] [ OPT(K)\fIcombi.lis\fP] [ OPT(L) ] 
[ OPT(Qe)|\fBi\fP ] [ OPT(Sl)|\fBu\fP|\fBh\fP\fIspeed\fP ] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ][ OPT(W)\fIsize\fP ] [ OPT(2) ] [ GMT_bo_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_cross\fP is used to determine all intersections between ("external cross-overs") or within
("internal cross-overs") tracks (Cartesian or geographic), and report the time, position, distance along track,
heading and speed along each track segment, and the crossover error (COE) and mean values for all observables.
The names of the tracks are passed on the command line.
By default, \fBx2sys_cross\fP will look for both external and internal COEs.  As an option,
you may choose to project all data using one of the map-projections prior to calculating the COE.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-F
Sets which columns to use.  Give a comma-separated list of column names;
this list must include \fBx\fP, \fBy\fP or \fBlon\fP, \fBlat\fP and ideally
\fBtime\fP [Default selects all columns].  If \fBtime\fP is not selected
(or selected but the cruises do not have time information), then we output
proxy times (e.g., floating point record numbers) instead of \fBtime\fP.
.TP
.B \-I
Sets the interpolation mode for estimating values at the crossover. Choose among:
.br
\fBl\fP Linear interpolation [Default].
.br
\fBa\fP Akima spline interpolation.
.br
\fBc\fP Cubic spline interpolation.
.br
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-K
Only process the pair-combinations found in the file \fIcombi.lis\fP
[Default process all possible combinations among the specified files].
.TP
.B \-L
Output results using the old XOVER format [Default is x2sys format].
This option should only be used with *.gmt-formatted MGD77 files.  See
the GMT mgg supplement for file description; see \fIWessel\fP [1989] for
details on the XOVER format.
.TP
.B \-Q
Append \fBe\fP for external COEs only, and \fBi\fP for internal
COEs only [Default is all COEs].
#include "explain_-Rgeo.txt"
For Cartesian data just give \fIxmin/xmax/ymin/ymax\fP.  This option limits
the COEs to those that fall inside the specified domain.
.TP
.B \-S
Defines window of track speeds.  If speeds are outside this window we do not
calculate a COE. Specify
.br
	\fB\-Sl\fP sets lower speed [Default is 0].
.br
	\fB\-Su\fP sets upper speed [Default is Infinity].
.br
	\fB\-Sh\fP does not limit the speed but sets a lower speed below which headings
will not be computed (i.e., set to NaN) [Default calculates headings regardless of speed].
.br
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Give the maximum number of data points on
either side of the crossover to use in the spline interpolation [3].
.TP
.B \-2
Report the values of each track at the crossover [Default reports the crossover value and the mean value].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
.SH REMARKS
The COEs found are printed out to standard output in ASCII format (unless
\fB\-bo\fP is set).  When ASCII is chosen, the output format depends on
whether or not old-style XOVER output (\fB\-L\fP) has been selected [See
the \fBx_over\fP man page for more details].
If ASCII, then the first record contains the name of the tag used, the second
records specifies the exact command line used for this run, and the third
record contains the names of each column.  For each track pair, there will be
a multisegment header record containing the two file names and their start/stop/dist
information (start/stop is absolute time or NaN if unavailable while dist is the
total track length),
whereas subsequent records have the data for each COE encountered.  The fields
written out are x, y, time along track #1 and #2, distance along track #1 and #2,
heading along track #1 and #2, velocity along track #1 and #2, and then pairs
of columns for each selected observable. These are either
pairs of (COE, average value) for each data type (or track-values #1 and #2; see \fB\-2\fP).
It is recommended that the Akima spline is used
instead of the natural cubic spline, since it is less sensitive to outliers
that tend to introduce wild oscillations in the interpolation.
.SH SIGN CONVENTION
If track_a and track_b are passed on the command line, then the COE value is Value
(track_a) - Value (track_b).
.SH PRECISION AND FORMAT
The output format of individual columns are controlled by \fBD_FORMAT\fP except for
geographic coordinates (\fBOUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT\fP) and absolute calendar time
(\fBOUTPUT_DATE_FORMAT\fP, \fBOUTPUT_CLOCK_FORMAT\fP).  Make sure these are set to
give you enough significant digits to achieve the desired precision.
.SH EXAMPLES
To compute all internal crossovers in the gmt-formatted file c2104.gmt, and
output in the old XOVER format, using the tag GMT, try
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_cross\fP c2104.gmt \fB\-L \-T\fPGMT > c2104.d
.br
.sp
To find the crossover locations with bathymetry between the two MGD77
files A13232.mgd77 and A99938.mgd77, using the MGD77 tag, try
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_cross\fP A13232.mgd77 A99938.mgd77 \fB\-Qe \-T\fPMGD77 \fB\-F\fPlon,lat,depth > crossovers.d
