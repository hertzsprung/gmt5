.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdview\fP reads a 2-D gridded file and produces a 3-D perspective plot by 
drawing a mesh, painting a colored/grayshaded surface made up of polygons, or by scanline conversion of these polygons
to a rasterimage.  Options include draping a data set on top of a surface, plotting of contours on top of the
surface, and apply artificial illumination based on intensities provided in a separate grid file.
.TP
\fIrelief_file\fP
2-D gridded data set to be imaged (the relief of the surface).
(See GRID FILE FORMAT below.)

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-C
name of the color palette file.  Must be present if you want (1) mesh plot with
contours (\fB\-Qm\fP), or (2) shaded/colored perspective image (\fB\-Qs\fP or \fB\-Qi\fP).
For \fB\-Qs\fP: You can specify that you want to skip a z-slice by setting red = -; to
use a pattern give red = \fBP|p\fP\fIdpi/pattern\fP[:\fBF\fP\fIr/g/b\fP[\fBB\fP\fIr/g/b\fP]].
.TP
.B \-E
Sets the view point by specifying azimuth and elevation in degrees. [Default is 180/90].
.TP
.B \-G
Drape the image in \fIdrapefile\fP on top of the relief provided by \fIrelief_file\fP. [Default is \fIrelief_file\fP].
Note that \fB\-Jz\fP and \fB\-N\fP always refers to the \fIrelief_file\fP.  The \fIdrapefile\fP only provides
the information pertaining to colors, which is looked-up via the cpt file (see \fB\-C\fP).  Alternatively, give
three grid files separated by commas.  These files must contain the red, green, and blue colors directly (in 0-255 range)
and no cpt file is needed.  The \fIdrapefile\fP may be of higher resolution than the \fIrelief_file\fP.
.TP
.B \-I
Gives the name of a grid file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range. [Default is no illumination].
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Boundary condition \fIflags\fP may be \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP or \fIxy\fP indicating data is periodic in range of
x or y or both, or \fIflags\fP may be \fIg\fP indicating geographical conditions (x and y are
lon and lat).  [Default uses "natural" conditions (second partial derivative normal to edge is zero).]
If no \fIflags\fP are set, use bilinear rather than the default bicubic resampling when draping is required.
.TP
.B \-N
Draws a plane at this z-level.  If the optional \fIcolor\fP is provided, the frontal facade between
the plane and the data perimeter is colored.  See OPT(Wf) for setting the pen used for the outline.
(See SPECIFYING COLOR below).
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-Q
Select one of four settings: 1. Specify \fBm\fP for mesh plot [Default], and optionally append /\fIcolor\fP for a different mesh paint [white].
2. Specify \fBs\fP for surface plot, and optionally append \fBm\fP to have mesh lines drawn on top of surface.
3. Specify \fBi\fP for image plot, and optionally append the effective dpi resolution for the rasterization [100].
4. Specify \fBc\fP.  Same as \fB\-Qi\fP but will make nodes with z = NaN transparent,
using the colormasking feature in \fIPostScript\fP Level 3 (the PS device must support PS Level 3).
For any of these choices, you may force a monochrome image by appending \fBg\fP.  Colors are then
converted to shades of gray using the (television) YIQ transformation.
#include "explain_-R.txt"
This option may be used to indicate the range used for the 3-D axes [Default is
region given by the \fIrelief_file\fP].  You may ask for a larger
\fIw/e/s/n\fP region to have more room between the image and the axes.  A smaller region
than specified in the \fIrelief_file\fP will result in a subset of the grid.
.TP
.B \-S
Smooth the contours before plotting (see \fBgrdcontour\fP) [Default is no smoothing].
.TP
.B \-T
Plot image without any interpolation.  This involves converting each node-centered
bin into a polygon which is then painted separately.  Append \fBs\fP to skip
nodes with z = NaN.  This option is useful for categorical data where
interpolating between values is meaningless.  Optionally, append \fBo\fP to
draw the tile outlines, and specify a custom pen if the default pen is not to
your liking.  As this option produces a flat surface it cannot be combined with OPT(JZ) or OPT(Jz).
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-Wc
Draw contour lines on top of surface or mesh (not image).  Append pen attributes used for the contours.
[Default: width = 3, color = black, texture = solid].
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
.TP
.B \-Wm
Sets the pen attributes used for the mesh. [Default: width = 1, color = black, texture = solid].
You must also select \fB\-Qm\fP or \fB\-Qsm\fP for meshlines to be drawn.
.TP
.B \-Wf
Sets the pen attributes used for the facade. [Default: width = 1, color = black, texture = solid].
You must also select OPT(N) for the facade outline to be drawn.
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
#include "explain_-XY.txt"
.TP
.B \-Z
Sets the z-level of the basemap [0].

.SH REMARKS
For the \fB\-Qs\fP option:  \fIPostScript\fP provides no way of smoothly varying colors within a polygon, so colors can only
vary from polygon to polygon.  To obtain smooth images this way you may resample the grid file(s) using \fBgrdsample\fP or
use a finer grid size when running gridding programs like \fBsurface\fP or \fBnearneighbor\fP.  Unfortunately,
this produces huge \fIPostScript\fP files.  The alternative is to use the \fB\-Qi\fP option, which
computes bilinear or bicubic continuous color variations within polygons by using scanline conversion to image the polygons.
