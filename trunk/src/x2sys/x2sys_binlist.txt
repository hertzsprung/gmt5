.TH X2SYS_BINLIST GMTMANSECTION DATE VERSION VERSION
.SH NAME
x2sys_binlist \- Create bin-index files from track data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP \fIfile(s)\fP [ \fB\-T\fP\fITAG\fP ] [ \fB\-D\fP[\fBf\fP] ] [ \fB\-V\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP reads one or more track data files and produces a multi-
segment ascii track bin index listing. 
The input files can be of any format, which must be described and passed with the
\fB\-T\fP option.  The bin index listing is a crude representation of where
the track goes and is used by the data archivist to determine which tracks
need to be compared for crossover analysis.  You must run \fBx2ys_init\fP
to initialize the tag before you can run the indexing.
.TP
\fIfiles\fP
Can be one or more binary or ASCII data files. To give a list of names,
use `cat list_of_files`.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments
.TP
.B \-D
Calculate the length of trackline segments per bin [Default skips this step].
Append \fBf\fP to use faster, "Flat-earth" calculations {Default uses great-circle
distances or geodesics depending on the current ELLIPSOID setting in GMT].
.TP
.B \-T
Sets the data set \fITAG\fP which among other things sets the definition file.

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a bin index table from the old-style GMT MGG file c2104.gmt using a global, 1x1 degree bin system, do
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP c2104.gmt \fB\-T\fPGMT > index.d
.br
.sp
To create a bin index list of all MGD77 files residing in the current directory at a bin resolution
of 30x30 minutes, run
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP *.mgd77 \fB\-T\fPMGD77 > index.d
