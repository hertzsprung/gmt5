OPT(Q)GMT_SAMP_OPT
Quick mode, use bilinear rather than bicubic interpolation [Default].
Alternatively, select the interpolation mode by adding BD(b) for B-spline smoothing,
BD(c) for bicubic interpolation, BD(l) for bilinear interpolation or BD(n) for
nearest-neighbor value.
Optionally, append IT(threshold) in the range [0,1].
This parameter controls how close to nodes with NaN values the
interpolation will go.  E.g., a IT(threshold) of 0.5 will interpolate about half way from a non-NaN to a
NaN node, whereas 0.1 will go about 90% of the way, etc. [Default is 1, which means none of the (4 or 16) nearby
nodes may be NaN].  OPT(Q0) will just return the value of the nearest node instead of interpolating.
This is the same as using OPT(Qn).
