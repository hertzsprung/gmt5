GMT_Rx_OPT
IT(xmin), IT(xmax), IT(ymin), and IT(ymax) specify the region of interest.  For geographic
regions, these limits correspond to IT(west), IT(east), IT(south), and IT(north) and you may specify them
in decimal degrees or in [+-]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format.  Append BD(r) if lower left and upper right
map coordinates are given instead of w/e/s/n.  The two shorthands OPT(Rg) and OPT(Rd) stand for global domain
(0/360 and -180/+180 in longitude respectively, with -90/+90 in latitude).  Alternatively, specify the name
of an existing grid file and the OPT(R) settings (and grid spacing, if applicable) are copied from the grid.
When OPT(R) is used without any further arguments, the values from the last use of OPT(R) in a previous BD(GMT)
command will be used.

For calendar time coordinates you may either give (a) relative
time (relative to the selected BD(TIME_EPOCH) and in the selected BD(TIME_UNIT); append BD(t) to
OPT(JX)|BD(x)), or (b) absolute time of the form [IT(date)]BD(T)[IT(clock)]
(append BD(T) to OPT(JX)|BD(x)).  At least one of IT(date) and IT(clock)
must be present; the BD(T) is always required.  The IT(date) string must be of the form [-]yyyy[-mm[-dd]]
(Gregorian calendar) or yyyy[-Www[-d]] (ISO week calendar), while the IT(clock) string must be of
the form hh:mm:ss[.xxx].  The use of delimiters and their type and positions must be exactly as indicated
(however, input, output and plot formats are customizable; see BD(gmt.conf)).
