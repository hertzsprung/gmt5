Dear GMT user-

We need to announce the release of GMT version 4.3.2.
This release fixes a series of minor problems and is a recommended
upgrade from the recently released GMT 4.3.1.  It also
introduces a new program (greenspline) for gridding and
interpolation using Green's function splines.  Note that
there is no change to GSHHS which still is version 1.10.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).


Sincerely,

The GMT Team
