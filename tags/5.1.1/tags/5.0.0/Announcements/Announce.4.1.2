Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.1.2
For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).  Note that the GSHHS
coastline data has seen minor correcetions and hence
the coastline files have been updated to 4.1.

At this point, the US mirrors have synced up, and we expect
the others to follow within 24 hours.  Note the Australia
mirror is down and will hopefully be replaced this summer.


Sincerely,

Paul Wessel
Walter H. F. Smith
