.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpslegend\fP will make legends that can be overlaid on maps.  It reads specific
legend-related information from an input file [or stdin].  Because all the elements
of the legend can already be created with other tools (\fBpsxy\fP, \fBpstext\fP) we
use those tools by creating a batch job of commands that are executed to make the final
\fIPostScript\fP overlay.  Because of this process, the option exists to just output the script which
can then be fine-tuned manually.  Unless otherwise noted, annotations will be made using the
annotation font and size in effect.
.TP
\fItextfile\fP
This file contains instruction for the layout of items in the legend.  Each legend item is described by
a unique record.  All records begin with a unique character that is common to all records of the same
kind.  The order of the legend items is implied by the order of the records.  Ten different record types
are recognized, and the syntax for each of these records are presented below:
.TP
\fB#\fP Comment records
Records starting with # and blank lines are skipped.
.TP
\fBB\fP \fIcptname offset height\fP [ \fIoptional arguments\fP ]
The B record will plot a horizontal color bar, \fBpsscale\fP-style in the middle, starting at \fIoffset\fP from
the left edge, and of the given \fIheight\fP.  You may add any additional \fPpsscale\fP options from the list:
\fB\-A \-B \-E \-I \-L \-M \-N \-S \fPand \fB\-Z\fP.
.TP
\fBC\fP \fItextcolor\fP
The C record specifies the color with which the remaining text is to be printed.
\fItextcolor\fP can be in the form \fIr/g/b\fP, \fIc/m/y/k\fP, or a named color.
.TP
\fBD\fP \fIoffset pen\fP
The D record results in a horizontal line across the legend.  The line starts and stops \fIoffset\fP
units from the frame sides, and is drawn using the specified \fIpen\fP.
.TP
\fBG\fP \fIgap\fP
The G record specifies a vertical gap of the given length.  In addition to the standard units (\fBi, c, p\fP) you
may use \fBl\fP for lines.
.TP
\fBH\fP \fIfontsize font Header\fP
The H record plots a centered text string using the specified font parameters.
.TP
\fBI\fP \fIimagefile width justification\fP
Place an EPS or Sun raster image in the legend justified relative to the current point.  The
image \fIwidth\fP determines the size of the image on the page.
.TP
\fBL\fP \fIfontsize font justification Label\fP
The L record plots a (L)eft, (C)entered, or (R)ight-justified text string using the specified font parameters.
.TP
\fBM\fP \fIslon\fP\fB|\fP- slat length\fP \fBf|p\fP [ \fB\-R\fP\fIw/e/s/n\fP \fB\-J\fP\fIparam\fP ]
Place a map scale in the legend.  Specify \fIslon slat\fP, the point on the map where the scale applies (\fIslon\fP
is only meaningful for certain oblique projections.  If not needed, you must specify - instead),
\fIlength\fP, the length of the scale in km (append \fBm\fP or \fBn\fP for miles or nautical miles), and
\fBf|p\fP for fancy or plain scale.  If the \fB\-R \-J\fP supplied to \fBpslegend\fP is different than the
projection needed for the scale, supply the optional \fB\-R \-J\fP settings as well.  Note that \fIlength\fP
can have \fI:label:just\fP appended, where \fIlabel\fP replaces the default label (unless - is given) and
\fIjust\fP (\fBl|r|t|b\fP) dictates where the label is placed [Default is \fBt\fP].  Use \fBu\fP to treat the
label as distance units appended to each annotation.
.TP
\fBN\fP \fIncolums\fP
Change the number of columns in the legend [1].
.TP
\fBS\fP \fIdx1 symbol size fill pen dx2 text\fP
Plots the selected symbol with specified size, fill, and outline.  The symbol is centered at \fIdx1\fP from the
left margin of the column, with the explanatory text starting \fIdx2\fP from the margin.  Use - if no fill
is required.  Two \fBpsxy\fP symbols front (f) and vector (v) require special attention.  You must prepend
the length of the desired item to the rest of the symbol argument; this will be used internally to set the
correct fault or vector length and will be stripped before passing the arguments to \fBpsxy\fP.
.TP
\fB>\fP <paragraph mode header for pstext>
Start a new text paragraph by specifying all the parameters needed (see \fBpstext \-M\fP description).  Note that
\fBpslegend\fP knows what all those values should be, so normally you can leave the entire record (after >) blank.
If you need to set at least one of the parameters directly, you must specify all and set the ones you want to leave
at their default value to -.
.TP
\fBT\fP \fIparagraph-text\fP
One or more of these T records with text must follow after the \fB>\fP record.
.TP
\fBV\fP \fIoffset pen\fP
The V record draws a vertical line between columns (if more than one) using the selected pen.  \fIoffset\fP is
analogous to the offset for the D records but in the vertical direction.
.TP
.B \-D
Positions the legend and specifies its size.  The \fIjust\fP is a 2-char justification string (see \fBpstext\fP)
that relates the given position to a point on the rectangular legend box.  If you want to specify the position
in projected units (i.e., inches or cm), use \fB\-Dx\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-C
Sets the clearance between the legend frame and the internal items [CLEARENCE_SI (or CLEARENCE_US)].
.TP
.B \-F
Draws a border around the legend using \fBFRAME_PEN\fP.
.TP
.B \-G
#include "explain_-G.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Sets the linespacing factor in units of the current annotation font size [1.1].
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-S
Instead of writing the \fIPostScript\fP plot [Default], output the \fBGMT\fP script used to make the legend
to standard output, or optionally to the file \fIscript\fP.
