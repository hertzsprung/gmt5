.SH NAME
grdmask \- Create mask grid files from xy paths.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrdmask\fP \fIpathfiles\fP OPT(G)\fImask_grd_file\fP] GMT_I_OPT 
GMT_Rgeo_OPT [ OPT(A)[\fBm\fP|\fBp\fP] ] [ OPT(F) ] [ GMT_H_OPT ] [ GMT_Mo_OPT ] 
[ OPT(N)\fIout/edge/in\fP ] [ OPT(S)\fIsearch_radius\fP[\fBm|c|k|K\fP] ] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ] [ GMT_t_OPT ] [ GMT_bi_OPT ] [ GMT_fi_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdmask\fP can operate in two different modes. 1. It reads one or more xy-files that each define a closed polygon.
The nodes defined by the specified region and lattice spacing will be set equal to one of three possible values
depending on whether the node is outside, on the polygon perimeter, or inside the polygon.  The
resulting mask may be used in subsequent operations involving \fBgrdmath\fP to mask out
data from polygonal areas. 2. The xy-files simply represent data point locations and the mask is set to the
inside or outside value depending on whether a node is within a maximum distance from the nearest data point.
If the distance specified is zero then only the nodes nearest each data point are considered "inside".
.TP
\fIpathfiles\fP
The name of 1 or more ASCII [or binary, see OPT(b)] files holding the polygon(s) or data points.
.TP
.B \-G
Name of resulting output mask grid file.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
If the input data are geographic (as indicated by \fB\-fi\fP) then the sides in the polygons will be
approximated by great circle arcs.  When using the \fB\-A\fP sides will be regarded as straight lines.
Alternatively, append \fBm\fP to have sides first follow meridians, then parallels. Or append \fBp\FP
to first follow parallels, then meridians.

#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-M
Multiple segment file.  Segments are separated by a record whose first character is \fIflag\fP.
[Default is '>'].
.TP
.B \-N
Sets the values that will be assigned to nodes that are \fIout\fPside the polygons,
on the \fIedge\fP, or \fIin\fPside.  Values can be any number, including the
textstring NaN  [Default is 0/0/1].
.TP
.B \-S
Set nodes depending on their distance from the nearest data point.  Nodes within \fIradius\fP [0] from
a data point are considered inside.  Append \fBm\fP to indicate minutes
or \fBc\fP to indicate seconds.  Append \fBk\fP to indicate km (implies \fB\-R\fP and \fB\-I\fP are in degrees, and
we will use a fast flat Earth approximation to calculate distance).  For more accuracy, use uppercase \fBK\fP
if distances should be calculated along geodesics.
However, if the current \fBELLIPSOID\fP is set to Sphere then spherical great circle calculations are used.
