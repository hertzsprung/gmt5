Control how aspatial data are handled in GMT during input and output.
.br
Reading OGR/GMT-formatted files.
To assign certain aspatial data items to GMT data columns,
give one or more comma-separated associations IT(col)=IT(name), where
IT(name) is the name of an aspatial attribute field in a OGR/GMT file
and whose value we wish to as data input for column IT(col).  In addition,
to assign an aspatial value to non-column data, you may specify IT(col) as
BD(D) for IT(distance), BD(G) for IT(fill), BD(L) for IT(label), BD(T)
for IT(text), BD(W) for IT(pen), and BD(Z) for IT(value)
[e.g., used to look-up color via a CPT].

Write OGR/GMT-formatted files.
Give one or more comma-separated associations IT(col)=IT(name)[:IT(type)],
To write OGR/GMT-formatted files, give one or more comma-separated associations IT(col)=IT(name)[:IT(type)],
with an optional data type from DOUBLE, FLOAT, INTEGER, CHAR, STRING, DATETIME, or LOGICAL [DOUBLE].
To extract information from GMT multisegment headers encoded in the OPT(D)IT(distance), OPT(G)IT(fill),
OPT(L)IT(label), OPT(T)IT(text), OPT(W)IT(pen), or OPT(Z)IT(value)
settings, specify IT(COL) as BD(D), BD(G), BD(L), BD(T), BD(W) or BD(Z), respectively; type will be set automatically.
Finally, you IT(must) append BD(+g)IT(geometry), where IT(geometry) is either POINT, LINE,
or POLY.  Optionally, prepend BD(M) for multi-versions of these geometries.  To force the clipping
of features crossing the Dateline, use upper-case BD(+G) instead.
See GMT Appendix Q for details of the OGR/GMT file format.
