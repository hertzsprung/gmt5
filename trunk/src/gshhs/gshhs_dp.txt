.SH NAME
gshhs_dp \- Line reduction using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(gshhs_dp) IT(input.b tolerance output.b) [ OPT(v) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(gshhs_dp) reads the binary coastline (GSHHS) or political boundary or river (WDBII) files and
and reduces the complexity of the line by applying the Douglas-Peucker algorithm.  It automatically
handles byte-swabbing between different architectures.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(input.b)
GSHHS or WDBII binary data file as distributed with the GSHHS data supplement.  Any of the
5 standard resolutions (full, high, intermediate, low, crude) can be used.
.TP
IT(tolerance)
tolerance is maximum mismatch in km.  The larger the value the more reduction will take place.
.TP
IT(output.b)
The reducted data set.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(v)
Reports progress and statistics while running.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To simplify the full GSHHS data set with a custom tolerance of 2 km, try
.sp
BD(gshhs_dp) IT(gshhs_f.b 2 gshhs_2km.b)
