.TP
.B \-M
Multiple segment file(s).  Segments are separated by a special record.
For ASCII files the first character must be \fIflag\fP [Default is '>'].
For binary files all fields must be NaN and \fB\-b\fP must
set the number of output columns explicitly.  By default the \fB\-M\fP
setting applies to both input and output.  Use \fB\-Mi\fB and \fB\-Mo\fB
to give them separate settings.
