.SH NAME
triangulate \- Perform optimal Delauney triangulation and gridding of Cartesian data [method]
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtriangulate\fP \fIinfiles\fP [ OPT(Dx)|\fBy\fP ] [ OPT(E)\fIempty\fP ] [ OPT(G)\fIgrdfile\fP ] 
[ GMT_H_OPT ] [ GMT_I_OPT ] [ GMT_J_OPT ] [ GMT_M_OPT ] 
[ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] [ OPT(Z) ] [ GMT_t_OPT ] 
[ GMT_b_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtriangulate\fP reads one or more ASCII [or binary] files (or standard input) containing x,y[,z] and
performs Delauney triangulation, i.e., it find how the points should be connected to give
the most equilateral triangulation possible.  If a map projection is chosen then it is applied before
the triangulation is calculated.  By default, the output is triplets of point id numbers
that make up each triangle and is written to standard output.
The id numbers refer to the points position (line number, starting at 0 for the first line) in the input file.
As an option, you may choose to create a multiple segment file that can be piped through
\fBpsxy\fP to draw the triangulation network.  If \fB\-G \-I\fP are set a grid will be calculated based
on the surface defined by the planar triangles.  The actual algorithm used
in the triangulations is either that of Watson [1982] [Default] or Shewchuk [1996] (if installed; type
\fBtriangulate \-\fP to see which method is selected).
This choice is made during the \fBGMT\fP installation.
.TP
\fIinfiles\fP
Data files with the point coordinates in ASCII (or binary; see \fB\-b\fP).  If no files are given the standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-D
Take either the \fIx\fP- or \fIy\fP-derivatives of surface represented
by the planar facets (only used when \fB\-G\fP is set).
.TP
.B \-E
Set the value assigned to empty nodes when \fB\-G\fP is set [NaN].
.TP
.B \-G
Use triangulation to grid the data onto an even grid (specified with \fB\-I, \-R\fP).  Append
the name of the output grid file.  The interpolation is performed in the
original coordinates, so if your triangles are close to the poles you are
better off projecting all data to a local coordinate system before using
\fBtriangulate\fP (this is true of all gridding routines).

.TP
.B \-I
\fIx_inc\fP [and optionally \fIy_inc\fP] sets the grid  size for optional grid output (see \fB\-G\fP).
Append \fBm\fP to indicate minutes or \fBc\fP to indicate seconds.
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-M
Output triangulation network as multiple line segments separated by a record whose first
character is \fIflag\fP [>].  To plot, use \fBpsxy\fP with the \fB\-M\fP option (see Examples).
#include "explain_-R.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-Z
Controls whether binary data file has two or three columns [2].  Ignored if \fB\-b\fP
is not set.
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 2 input columns].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default is same as input].
Node ids are stored as binary 4-byte integer triplets.  \fB\-bo\fP is ignored if \fB\-M\fP is selected.
