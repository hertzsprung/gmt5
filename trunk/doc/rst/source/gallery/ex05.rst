(5) A 3-D illuminated surface (in bw)
-------------------------------------

Instead of a mesh plot we may choose to show 3-D surfaces using
artificial illumination. For this example we will use
`grdmath <../grdmath.html>`_ to make a grid file that
contains the surface given by the function
:math:`z(x, y) = \cos (2\pi r/8)\cdot e^{-r/10}`, where
:math:`r^2 = (x^2 + y^2)`. The illumination is obtained by passing two
grid files to `grdview <../grdview.html>`_: One with the
*z*-values (the surface) and another with intensity values (which should
be in the 1 range). We use
`grdgradient <../grdgradient.html>`_ to compute the
horizontal gradients in the direction of the artificial light source.
The ``gray.cpt`` file only has one line that states that all *z* values should have
the gray level 128. Thus, variations in shade are entirely due to
variations in gradients, or illuminations. We choose to illuminate from
the SW and view the surface from SE:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/ex05/example_05.sh

The variations in intensity could be made more dramatic by using
`grdmath <../grdmath.html>`_ to scale the intensity file
before running `grdview <../grdview.html>`_. For very rough
data sets one may improve the smoothness of the intensities by passing
the output of `grdgradient <../grdgradient.html>`_ to
`grdhisteq <../grdhisteq.html>`_. The shell-script above
will result in a plot like the one in Figure.
