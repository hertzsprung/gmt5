Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.5.3.
This release mostly fixes several bugs. We also had to make
a few more changes to the netCDF GSHHS files (2.1.0) to fix
errors in the political boundary files. Note GSHHS 2.1.0 is
required for GMT 4.5.3.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

As of this notice, all but the Japan, Vienna and S Africa mirror
ftp servers are now synced up; we hope those three will follow
within 24 hours.  Alternatively, OS X users will find GMT 4.5.3
and GSHHS 2.1.0 in Fink's 'unstable' tree.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
