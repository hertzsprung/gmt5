.SH NAME
sample1d \- Resample 1-D table data using splines
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(sample1d) [ IT(table) ] [ OPT(A)BD(m)|BD(p) ] [ OPT(Fl)|BD(a)|BD(c)|BD(n) ] [ OPT(I)IT(inc)[IT(unit)] ] 
[ OPT(N)IT(knotfile) ] [ OPT(S)IT(start)[/IT(stop)] ] [ OPT(T)IT(col) ] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ] [ GMT_b_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ] [ GMT_g_OPT ] [ GMT_h_OPT ] [ GMT_i_OPT ] [ GMT_o_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(sample1d) reads a multi-column ASCII [or binary] data set from file [or standard input] and interpolates the
timeseries/profile at locations where the user needs the values.  The user must provide
the column number of the independent (monotonically increasing BD(or) decreasing) variable.  Equidistant or arbitrary sampling can
be selected.  All columns are resampled based on the new sampling interval.
Several interpolation schemes are available.  Extrapolation outside the range of the input data is not supported.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
None.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(table)
This is one or more ASCII [of binary, see GMT_bi_OPT] files with one column containing the independent variable (which must
be monotonically in/de-creasing) and the remaining columns holding other data values.
If no file is provided, BD(sample1d) reads from standard input.
.TP
OPT(A)BD(m)|BD(p)
For spherical surface resampling (see OPT(I)) we resample along great circle arcs.
Alternatively, use OPT(Am) to resample by first following a meridian,
then a parallel. Or use OPT(Ap) to start following a parallel, then a meridian.
(This can be practical for resampling lines along parallels, for example).
.TP
OPT(Fl)|BD(a)|BD(c)|BD(n)
Choose from BD(l) (Linear), BD(a) (Akima spline), BD(c) (natural cubic spline),
and BD(n) (no interpolation: nearest point) [Default is OPT(Fa)].
You may change the default interpolant; see BD(GMT_INTERPOLANT) in your BD(gmt.conf) file.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(inc)[IT(unit)]
IT(inc) defines the sampling interval [Default is the separation between the first and
second abscissa point in the IT(infile)].
Append a distance unit (see UNITS) to indicate that the first two columns contain
longitude, latitude and you wish to resample this path using spherical segments with a nominal spacing of
IT(inc) in the chosen units.  See OPT(Am)|BD(p) to only sample along meridians and parallels.
.TP
OPT(N)IT(knotfile)
IT(knotfile) is an optional ASCII file with the x locations where the data set will be resampled in the first column.
Note: If OPT(H) is selected it applies to both IT(infile) and IT(knotfile).  Also note that OPT(i) never applies
to IT(knotfile) since we always consider the first column only.
.TP
OPT(S)IT(start)
For equidistant sampling, IT(start) indicates the location of the first output value. [Default
is the smallest even multiple of IT(inc) inside the range of IT(infile)].  Optionally,
append /IT(stop) to indicate the location of the last output value [Default is the
largest even multiple of IT(inc) inside the range of IT(infile)].
.TP
OPT(T)IT(col)
Sets the column number of the independent variable [Default is 0 (first)].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 2 (or at least the number of columns implied by OPT(T))].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default is same as input].
#include "explain_-f.txt"
#include "explain_-g.txt"
#include "explain_-h.txt"
#include "explain_-icols.txt"
#include "explain_-ocols.txt"
#include "explain_help.txt"
#include "explain_distunits.txt"
#include "explain_precision.txt"
.SH CALENDAR TIME SAMPLING
If the abscissa are calendar times then you must use the OPT(f) option to indicate this.  Furthermore,
OPT(I) then expects an increment in the current BD(TIME_UNIT) units.  There is not yet support for
variable intervals such as months.
.SH EXAMPLES
To resample the file profiles.tdgmb, which contains (time,distance,gravity,magnetics,bathymetry) records,
at 1km equidistant intervals using Akima's spline, use\"'
.br
.sp
sample1d profiles.tdgmb -I1 -Fa -T1 > profiles_equi_d.tdgmb
.br
.sp
To resample the file depths.dt at positions listed in the file grav_pos.dg, using a cubic spline
for the interpolation, use
.br
.sp
sample1d depths.dt -Ngrav_pos.dg -Fc > new_depths.dt
.br
.sp
To resample the file track.txt which contains lon, lat, depth every 2 nautical miles, use
.br
.sp
sample1d track.txt -I2n > new_track.dt
