.SH NAME
grdreformat \- Converting between different grdfile formats.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrdreformat\fP \fIingrdfile\fP[\fI=id\fP[\fI/scale/offset\fP[\fI/NaNvalue\fP]]] \fIoutgrdfile\fP[\fI=id\fP[\fI/scale/offset\fP[\fI/NaNvalue\fP]]] 
 [ \fB\-N\fP ] [ \fB\-R\fP\fIwest/east/south/north\fP[\fBr\fP] ] [ \fB\-V\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdreformat\fP reads a grdfile in one format and writes it out using another format.  As an option the
user may select a subset of the data to be written and to specify scaling, translation, and NaN-value.
.TP
\fIingrdfile\fP
The grdfile to be read.  Append format =\fIid\fP code if not a standard COARDS-compliant netCDF grdfile.
If =\fIid\fP is set (see below), you may optionally append \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP.
These options will scale the data and then offset them with the specified amounts after reading.
.br
If \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP
are supplied you may also append a value that represent 'Not-a-Number' (for floating-point grids this
is unnecessary since the IEEE NaN is used; however integers need a value which means no data available.)
.TP
\fIoutgrdfile\fP
The grdfile to be written.  Append format =\fIid\fP code if not a standard COARDS-compliant netCDF grdfile.
If =\fIid\fP is set (see below), you may optionally append \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP.
These options are particularly 
practical when storing the data as integers, first removing an offset and then scaling down the values.
Since the scale and offset are applied in reverse order when reading, this does not affect the data
values (except for round-offs).
.br
If \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP
are supplied you may also append a value that represent 'Not-a-Number' (for floating-point grids this
is unnecessary since the IEEE NaN is used; however integers need a value which means no data available.)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-N
Suppress the writing of the \fBGMT\fP header structure.  This is useful when you want to write a native grid to
be used by \fBgrdraster\fP.  It only applies to native grids and is ignored for netCDF output.

.SH FORMAT IDENTIFIER
By default, grids will be written as floating point data stored in binary files using the netCDF format and
meta-data structure. This format is conform the COARDS conventions. \fBGMT\fP versions prior to 4.1 produced
netCDF files that did not conform to these conventions. Although these files are still supported, their use is
depreciated. To write other than floating point COARDS-compliant netCDF files, append the =\fIid\fP suffix
to the filename \fIoutgrdfile\fP.
.br
When reading files, \fBgrdreformat\fP and other \fBGMT\fP programs will automatically recognize any type
of netCDF grdfile. These can be in either COARDS-compliant or pre-4.1 format, and contain floating-point or
integer data. To read other types of grdfiles, append the =\fIid\fP suffix to the filename \fIingrdfile\fP.

.SH GMT STANDARD NETCDF FILES
The standard format used for gdrfiles is based on netCDF and conforms to the COARDS conventions. Files written
in this format can be read by numerous third-party programs and are platform-independent. Some disk-space
can be saved by storing the data as bytes or shorts in stead of integers. Use the \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP
parameters to make this work without loss of data range or significance. For more details, see Appendix B.
.SH NATIVE BINARY FILES
For binary native \fBGMT\fP files the size of the \fBGMT\fP grdheader block is \fIhsize\fP = 896 bytes, and the total size of the file
is \fIhsize\fP + \fInx\fP * \fIny\fP * \fIitem_size\fP, where \fIitem_size\fP is the size in bytes of each element (1, 2, 4).  Bit grids
are stored using 4-byte integers, each holding 32 bits, so for these files the size equation is modified by
using ceil (\fInx\fP / 32) * 4 instead of \fInx\fP.
Note that these files are platform-dependent. Files written on Little Endian machines (e.g. PCs) can not be
read on Big Endian machines (e.g. most workstations).
For header and grid details, see Appendix B.
.SH EXAMPLES
To create a 4-byte native floating point grid from the COARDS-compliant netCDF file data.grd:
.br
.sp
\fBgrdreformat\fP data.grd ras_data.b4=bf \fB\-V\fP
.br
.sp
To make a 2-byte short integer file, scale it by 10, subtract 32000, setting
NaNs to -9999, do
.br
.sp
\fBgrdreformat\fP values.grd shorts.i2=bs/10/-32000/-9999 \fB\-V\fP
.br
.sp
To create a Sun standard 8-bit rasterfile for a subset of the data file image.grd,
assuming the range in image.grd is 0-1 and we need 0-255, run
.br
.sp
\fBgrdreformat\fP image.grd \fB\-R\fP-60/-40/-40/-30 image.ras8=rb/255/0 \fB\-V\fP
.br
.sp
To convert etopo2.grd to etopo2.i2 that can be used by \fBgrdraster\fP, try
.br
.sp
\fBgrdreformat\fP etopo2.grd etopo2.i2=bs \fB\-N \-V\fP
