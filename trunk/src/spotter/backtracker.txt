.SH NAME
backtracker \- Forward and Backward flowlines and hotspot tracks 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbacktracker\fP [\fIinfile(s)\fP] OPT(E)\fIrotations.txt\fP | OPT(e)\fIlon\fP/\fIlat\fP/\fIangle\fP
[ OPT(A)[\fIyoung\fP/\fIold\fP] ] [ OPT(C) ] [ OPT(Df)|\fBb\fP ] [ GMT_H_OPT ] 
[ OPT(Lf)|\fBb\fP\fIstep\fP ] [ GMT_M_OPT ] [ OPT(N)\fIupper_age\fP ] 
[ OPT(Q)\fIfixed_age\fP ] [ OPT(S)\fIfilestem\fP ] [ OPT(T)\fIzero_age\fP ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] 
[ OPT(W)[\fBa\fP|\fBt\fP] ] [ GMT_t_OPT ] [ GMT_b_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbacktracker\fP reads (longitude, latitude, age) positions from \fIinfiles\fP 
[or standard input] and computes projected (x,y,t) coordinates using the 
specified rotation parameters.  It can either calculate final
positions [Default] or create a sampled track between the initial and final
positions.  The former mode allows additional data fields after the first 3
columns which must have (longitude,latitude,age).
See option \fB\-:\fP on how to read (latitude,longitude,age) files.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIinfile(s)\fP
Data file(s) to be projected.  If not given, standard input is read.
#include "euler.txt"
.TP
.B \-e
Alternatively, specify the longitude, latitude, and opening angle (all in degrees
and separated by /) for a single total reconstruction
rotation that should be applied to all input points.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Used in conjunction with \fB\-Lb|f\fP to limit the track output to those sections
whose predicted ages fit between the \fIyoung\fP and \fIold\fP limits.  If \fB\-LB|F\fP
is used instead then the limits apply to the stage ids.  If no limits are supplied
then individual limits for each seamount are expected in columns 4 and 5 of the input file.
.TP
.B \-C
Expect Total Reconstruction Poles rather than Backward Stage Poles [Default].
File format is similar to the stage pole format except the youngest rotation must be listed
first and that the \fItstart\fP column is optional (assumed to be 0 Ma).  Requires OPT(E).
.TP
.B \-D
Set the direction to go: \fB\-Df\fP will go forward in time (from younger to older positions), while
\fB\-Db\fP will go backward in time (from older to younger positions) [Default].
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Specify a sampled path between initial and final position: \fB\-Lf\fP will
draw flowlines, while \fB\-Lb\fP will draw backtrack (hotspot track) paths.
Append sampling interval in km.  If \fIstep\fP < 0 then only the bend-times (knots)
will be returned.  When \fB\-LF\fP or \fB\-LB\fP is used, the
third output column will contain the stage id (1 is youngest) [Default is
along-track ages].
#include "explain_-M.txt"
.TP
.B \-N
Set the maximum age to extend the oldest stage back in time [Default is no extension].
.TP
.B \-Q
Assign a fixed age to all positions.  Only lon, lat input is expected.
.TP
.B \-S
When \fB\-L\fP is set, the tracks are normally written to stdout as a multisegment
file.  Specify a \fIfilestem\fP to have each track written to \fIfilestem.#\fP, where
\fI#\fP is the track number.  The track number is also copied to the 4th output column.
.TP
.B \-T
Set the current time [Default is 0 Ma].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Rotates the given input (lon,lat,t) and calculates the confidence ellipse for the
projected point.  The input point \fImust\fP have a time coordinate that matches
a particular finite rotation time, otherwise the point will be skipped.  Append
\fBt\fP or \fBa\fP to output time or angle, respectively, after the projected
lon, lat.  After these 2-3 items, we write azimuth, major, minor (in km) for the
95% confidence ellipse.
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 3 input columns].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default depends on settings].
.SH EXAMPLES
To backtrack the (x,y,t) points in the file seamounts.d to their origin
(presumably the hotspot), using the DC85.d Euler poles, run
.br
.sp
\fBbacktracker\fP seamounts.d \fB\-Db \-E\fPDC85.d > newpos.d
.br
.sp
To project flowlines forward from the (x,y,t) points stored in several 3-column,
binary, double precision files, run
.br
.sp
\fBbacktracker\fP points.* \fB\-Df \-E\fPDC85.d \fB\-Lf\fP25 \fB\-bo \-bi\fP\fI3\fP > lines.b
.br
.sp
This file can then be plotted with \fBpsxy \-M\fP.
