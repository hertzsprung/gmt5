.SH NAME
ps2raster \- Converts one or several \fIPostScript\fP file(s) to other formats using GhostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBps2raster\fP \fIpsfile(s)\fP [ OPT(A) ] [ OPT(E)\fIresolution\fP ] [ OPT(G)\fIghost_path\fP ] 
[ OPT(L)\fIlistfile\fP]  [ OPT(N) ] [ OPT(Te)|\fBf\fP|\fBj\fP|\fBg\fP|\fBm\fP|\fBt\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBps2raster\fP reads one or more \fIPostScript\fP files (or a file with a list of \fIPostScript\fP filenames) and modifies the
page size in order that the resulting image will have a size determined by the BoundingBox.
As an option, a tight BoundingBox may be computed first.
.TP
\fIpsfiles\fP
Names of \fIPostScript\fP files to be converted. The output files will have the same name but with the
conventional extension name associated to the raster format (e.g. .jpg for the jpeg format).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Adjust the BoundingBox to the minimum required by the image content.
.TP
.B \-E
Set raster resolution in dpi [default = 720 for PDF, 300 for others].
.TP
.B \-G
Full path to your ghostscript executable.
NOTE: For Unix systems this is generally not necessary.
However, under Windows, GhostScript is not added to the system's path. So either you do it yourself,\"'
or give the full path here. (e.g., \fB\-G\fPc:\\programs\\gs\\gs7.05\\bin\\gswin32c).
.TP
.B \-L
The \fIlistfile\fP is an ASCII file with the names of the \fIPostScript\fP files to be converted.
.TP
.B \-N
Do \fInot\fP remove auxiliary files (by default it does). Auxiliary files are built using as base the input
\fIPostScript\fP files and consist of:
psfile_tmpxx.eps -> \fIPostScript\fP with a modified BoundingBox
psTOraster.bat -> script with the ghostscript command that does the job.
Use this option to save the script and run it later with different settings.
.TP
.B \-T
Sets the output format, where \fBe\fP means EPS, \fBf\fP means PDF, \fBj\fP means JPEG, \fBg\fP means PNG,
\fBm\fP means PPM, and \fBt\fP means TIF [default is JPEG].
.SH NOTES
The conversion to raster images (JPEG, PNG, PPM or TIF) inherently results in loss of details that are
available in the original PostScript file. Choose a resolution that is large enough for the application that
the image will be used for. For web pages, smaller dpi values suffice, for Word documents and PowerPoint presentations
a higher dpi value is recommended. \fBps2raster\fP uses the loss-less Flate compression technique when
creating JPEG, PNG and TIF images.

.sp
EPS is a vector, not a raster format. Therefore, the \fB-E\fP option has no effect on the creation
of EPS files. Using the option \fB-Te\fP will remove PageSize commands from the \fIPostScipt\fP file and will
adjust the BoundingBox when the \fB-A\fP option is used.
.br
.sp
Although PDF is also a vector format, the \fB-E\fP option has an effect on the resolution of pattern fills
and fonts that are stored as bitmaps in the document. \fBps2raster\fP therefore uses a larger default
resolution when creating PDF files. In order to obtain high-quality PDF files, the \fI/prepress\fP options in effect,
allowing only loss-less compression of raster images embedded in the PostScript file.

See Appendix C of the \fBTechnical Reference and Cookbook\fI for more information on how to use
\fBps2raster\fP on graphics that needs to be loaded into other documents (articles, presentations,
posters, etc.).
