.SH NAME
grd2cpt \- Read a grdfile and make a color palette file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrd2cpt\fP \fIgrdfile\fP [ \fB\-C\fP\fIcptmaster\fP ] [ \fB\-I\fP ] 
[ \fB\-L\fP\fIminlimit/maxlimit\fP ]  
[ \fB\-S\fP\fIzstart/zstop/zinc\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] [ \fB\-Z\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrd2cpt\fP reads a grdfile and writes a color palette (cpt) file to
standard output.  The cpt file is based on an existing master cptfile of
your choice, and the mapping from data value to colors is through the
data's cumulative distribution function (CDF), so that the colors are
histogram equalized.  Thus if the resulting cpt file is used with the
grdfile and grdimage with a linear projection, the colors will be uniformly
distributed in area on the plot.  Let z be the data values in the grdfile. 
Define CDF(Z) = (# of z < Z) / (# of z in grdfile).  (NaNs are ignored).
These z-values are then normalized to the master cptfile and colors are
sampled at the desired intervals.
.TP
\fIgrdfile\fP
The 2-D binary grdfile used to derive the color palette table.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-C
Selects the master color table to use in the interpolation.  Choose among
the built-in tables (type \fBgrd2cpt\fP to see the list) or give the
name of an existing cptfile [Default gives a rainbow cpt file].
.TP
.B \-I
Reverses the sense of color progression in the master cptfile.
.TP
.B \-L
Limit range of cptfile to \fIminlimit/maxlimit\fP, and don't count data
outside range when estimating CDF(Z).  [Default uses min and max of data.] 
.TP
.B \-S
Set steps in cpt file.  Calculate entries in cptfile from \fIzstart\fP to \fIzstop\fP
in steps of (\fIzinc\fP).  [Default chooses arbitrary values by a crazy scheme.] .TP
.B \-V
Verbose operation.  This will write CDF(Z) estimates to stderr.  [Default is silent.] 
.SH EXAMPLES
Sometimes you don't want to make a cpt file (yet) but would find it helpful
to know that 90% of your data lie between z1 and z2, something you cannot
learn from \fBgrdinfo\fP.  So you can do this to see some points on the
CDF(Z) curve (use \fB\-V\fP option to see more):
.br
.sp
grd2cpt mydata.grd \fB\-V\fP > /dev/null
.br
.sp
To make a cpt file with entries from 0 to 200 in steps of 20, and ignore
data below zero in computing CDF(Z), and use the built-in master cptfile
relief, try
.br
.sp
grd2cpt mydata.grd \fB\-C\fP\fIrelief\fP \fB-L\fP0/10000 \fB-S\fP0/200/20 > mydata.cpt
