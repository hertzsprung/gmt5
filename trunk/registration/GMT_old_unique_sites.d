#	This is a list of unique, verified block-averaged locations
#	of GMT registration sites.  It is obtained
#	from old registration forms, new online registrations
#	that have been manually checked, and old tape sales
#	When new points are verified from the .regdir files
#	pls delete those files after added the verified points to
#	this file.  The new version contains a 3rd column with the
#	total number of registrations for each 15' bin.
