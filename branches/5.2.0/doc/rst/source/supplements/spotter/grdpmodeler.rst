Description
-----------

**grdpmodeler** reads a geographical age grid and a plate motion model
and evaluates one of several model predictions. Optionally, the user may
supply a clipping polygon in multiple-segment format; then, only the
part of the grid inside the polygon is used to determine the model
prediction; the remainder of the grid is set to NaN.

Required Arguments
------------------

*ingrdfile*
    Name of a grid file in geographical (lon, lat) coordinates with ages
    in Myr.
**-E**\ *rotfile*
    Give file with rotation parameters. This file must contain one
    record for each rotation; each record must be of the following
    format:

    *lon lat tstart [tstop] angle* [ *khat a b c d e f g df* ]

    where *tstart* and *tstop* are in Myr and *lon lat angle* are in
    degrees. *tstart* and *tstop* are the ages of the old and young ends
    of a stage. If *tstop* is not present in the record then a total
    reconstruction rotation is expected and *tstop* is implicitly set to
    0 and should not be specified for any of the records in the file. If
    a covariance matrix **C** for the rotation is available it must be
    specified in a format using the nine optional terms listed in
    brackets. Here, **C** = (*g*/*khat*)\*[ *a b d; b c e; d e f* ]
    which shows **C** made up of three row vectors. If the degrees of
    freedom (*df*) in fitting the rotation is 0 or not given it is set
    to 10000. Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will
    be ignored. You may prepend a leading + to the filename to indicate
    you wish to invert the rotations.
    Alternatively, give the filename composed of two plate IDs
    separated by a hyphen (e.g., PAC-MBL) and we will instead extract
    that rotation from the GPlates rotation database. We return an error
    if the rotation cannot be found.

**-G**\ *outgrdfile*
    Name of output grid. This is the grid with the model predictions
    given the specified rotations.
**-S**\ **a**\ \|\ **d**\ \|\ **r**\ \|\ **w**\ \|\ **x**\ \|\ **y**\ \|\ **X**\ \|\ **Y**
    Type of model prediction. Choose from **a** for plate motion
    azimuth, **d** for distance between current locations and their
    origin at the ridge (in km), **r** for plate motion rate (in mm/yr),
    **w** for plate rotation rate (degree/Myr), **x** change in
    longitude relative to location of crust formation, **y** change in
    latitude relative to location of crust formation, **X** longitude of
    crust formation, and **Y** latitude of crust formation.

Optional Arguments
------------------

**-F**\ *polygonfile*
    Specify a multisegment closed polygon file that describes the inside
    area of the grid where the model should be evaluated; the outside
    will be set to NaN [Default evaluates model on the entire grid].
**-T**\ *age*
    Use a fixed age for model evaluation (i.e., override the ages in the
    age grid). This lets you evaluate the model at a snapshot in time.

Examples
--------

We will use a grid with Pacific crust ages (pac_age.nc), a plate motion
model (Pac_APM.d), and a polygon that contains the outline of the
present Pacific plate (pac_clip_path.d). To evaluate the plate motion
azimuths at the present time for the Pacific, try

   ::

    gmt grdpmodeler pac_age.nc -EPac_APM.d -V -Fpac_clip_path.d \
                    -Gpac_dir_0.nc -Sa -T0

To determine the changes in latitude since crust formation for the
entire Pacific, try

   ::

    gmt grdpmodeler pac_age.nc -EPac_APM.d -V -Fpac_clip_path.d \
                    -Gpac_dlat.nc -Sy

To determine the plate motion rates in effect when the Pacific crust was
formed, try

   ::

    gmt grdpmodeler pac_age.nc -EPac_APM.d -V -Fpac_clip_path.d \
                    -Gpac_vel.nc -Sr

To determine how far the crust has moved since formation, try

   ::

    gmt grdpmodeler pac_age.nc -EPac_APM.d -V -Fpac_clip_path.d \
                    -Gpac_dist.nc -Sd
