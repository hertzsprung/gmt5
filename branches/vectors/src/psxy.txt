.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(psxy) reads (IT(x),IT(y)) pairs from IT(files) [or standard input] and
generates IT(PostScript) code that will plot lines, polygons, or symbols at those locations on a map.
If a symbol is selected and no symbol size given, then BD(psxy) will interpret the third column of the
input data as symbol size.  Symbols whose IT(size) is <= 0 are skipped.
If no symbols are specified then the symbol code (see OPT(S) below)
must be present as last column in the input.
If OPT(S) is not used, a line connecting the data points will be drawn instead.
To explicitly close polygons, use OPT(L).  Select a fill with OPT(G).
If OPT(G) is set, OPT(W) will control whether the polygon outline is drawn or not.
If a symbol is selected, OPT(G) and OPT(W) determines the fill and outline/no outline, respectively.
The IT(PostScript) code is written to standard output.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
#include "explain_-J.txt"
#include "explain_-R.txt"
#include "explain_-Rz.txt"
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
#include "explain_intables.txt"
Use OPT(T) to ignore all input files, including standard input (see below).
.TP
 OPT(A)[BD(m)|BD(p)]
By default line segments are drawn as great circle arcs. To draw them as straight lines,
use the OPT(A) flag. Alternatively, add BD(m) to draw the line by first following a meridian,
then a parallel. Or append BD(p) to start following a parallel, then a meridian.
(This can be practical to draw a lines along parallels, for example).
#include "explain_-B.txt"
.TP
OPT(C)IT(cptfile)
Give a color palette file.  If OPT(S) is set, let symbol fill color be determined by the
z-value in the third column.  Additional fields are shifted over by one column
(optional size would be 4th rather than 3rd field, etc.).
If OPT(S) is not set, then BD(psxy) expects the user to supply a multisegment file
where each segment header contains a OPT(Z)IT(val) string.  The IT(val)
will control the color of the line or polygon (if OPT(L) is set) via the cpt file.
.TP
OPT(D)IT(dx)/IT(dy)
Offset the plot symbol or line locations by the given amounts IT(dx/dy) [Default is no offset].
If IT(dy) is not given it is set equal to IT(dx).
.TP
OPT(E)[BD(x)|BD(y)|BD(X)|BD(Y)][BD(n)][IT(cap)][/[BD(-)|BD(+)]IT(pen)]
Draw error bars.  Append BD(x) and/or BD(y) to indicate which bars you want to draw (Default is both x and y).  The x and/or
y errors must be stored in the columns after the (x,y) pair [or (x,y,size) triplet].  The
IT(cap) parameter indicates the length of the end-cap on the error bars [CAP].  Pen
attributes for error bars may also be set [Defaults: width = default, color = black, style = solid].
A leading BD(+) will use the lookup color (via OPT(C)) for both symbol fill and error pen color, while a leading
BD(-) will set error pen color and turn off symbol fill.
If upper case BD(X) and/or BD(Y) is used we will instead draw "box-and-whisker" (or "stem-and-leaf") symbols.  The x (or y)
coordinate is then taken as the median value, and 4 more columns are expected to contain the minimum (0% quantile), the 25%
quantile, the 75% quantile, and the maximum (100% quantile) values.  The 25-75% box may be filled by using OPT(G).
If BD(n) is appended to BD(X) (or BD(Y)) we draw a notched "box-and-whisker" symbol where the notch width reflects
the uncertainty in the median.  Then a 5th extra data column is expected to contain the number of points in the distribution.
.TP
OPT(G)IT(fill)
Select color or pattern for filling of symbols or polygons [Default is no fill].
.br
Note that BD(psxy) will search for OPT(G) and OPT(W)
strings in all the segment headers and let any values thus found over-ride the command line settings.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(intens)
Use the supplied IT(intens) value (nominally in the -1 to + 1 range) to modulate the fill color by simulating illumination [none].
#include "explain_-Jz.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
OPT(L)
Force closed polygons: connect the endpoints of the line-segment(s) and draw polygons.
Also, in concert with OPT(C) and any OPT(Z) settings in the headers will use the implied
color for polygon fill [Default is polygon pen color].
.TP
OPT(N)
Do NOT skip symbols that fall outside map border [Default plots points inside border only].
The option does not apply to lines and polygons which are always clipped to the map region.
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
#undef THREE_D
#include "explain_symbols.txt"
.TP
OPT(T)
Ignore all input files, including standard input. This is the same as specifying /dev/null (or NUL for
Windows users) as input file. Use this to activate only the options that are not related to plotting
of lines or symbols, such as BD(psxy) OPT(R) OPT(J) OPT(O) OPT(T) to terminate a sequence of
BD(GMT) plotting commands without producing any plotting output.
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)[BD(-)|BD(+)][IT(pen)]
Set pen attributes for lines or the outline of symbols [Defaults: width = default, color = black, style = solid].
A leading BD(+) will use the lookup color (via OPT(C)) for both symbol fill and outline pen color, while a leading
BD(-) will set outline pen color and turn off symbol fill.

.SH SEGMENT HEADER PARSING
Segment header records may contain one of more of the following options:
.br
OPT(G)IT(fill)	Use the new IT(fill) and turn filling on
.br
OPT(G-)		Turn filling off
.br
OPT(G)		Revert to default fill (none if not set on command line)
.br
OPT(W)IT(pen)	Use the new IT(pen) and turn outline on
.br
OPT(W)		Revert to default pen BD(MAP_DEFAULT_PEN) (if not set on command line)
.br
OPT(W-)		Turn outline off
.br
OPT(Z)IT(zval)	Obtain fill via cpt lookup using z-value IT(zval)
.br
OPT(ZNaN)	Get the NaN color from the cpt file
.SH CUSTOM SYMBOLS
BD(psxy) allows users to define and plot their own custom symbols.
This is done by encoding the symbol using our custom symbol macro code described in Appendix N.
Put all the macro codes for your new symbol in a file whose extension must be .def; you may then address
the symbol without giving the extension (e.g., the symbol file tsunami.def is used by specifying OPT(Sk)IT(tsunami/size).
The definition file can contain any number of plot code records, as well as blank lines and comment lines (starting with #).
BD(psxy) will look for the definition files in (1) the current directory, (2) the ~/.gmt
directory, and (3) the BD($GMT_SHAREDIR)/custom directory, in that order.
Freeform polygons (made up of straight line segments and arcs of circles) can be designed - these polygons can be
painted and filled with a pattern.  Other standard geometric symbols can also be used.  See Appendix N for macro definitions.
.br
BD(psxy) cannot handle filling of polygons that contain the south or north pole.  For such a polygon,
make a copy and split it into two and make each explicitly contain the polar point.  The two polygons
will combine to give the desired effect when filled; to draw outline use the original polygon.
