.. _example_08:

(8) A 3-D histogram
-------------------

The program `psxyz <../psxyz.html>`_ allows us to plot
three-dimensional symbols, including columnar plots. As a simple
demonstration, we will convert a gridded netCDF of bathymetry into an
ASCII *xyz* table and use the height information to draw a 2-D
histogram in a 3-D perspective view. Our gridded bathymetry file is
called ``guinea_bay.nc`` and covers the region from 0 to 5 E and 0 to 5 N. Depth ranges
from -5000 meter to sea-level. We produce the Figure by running this script:
