List of unresolved bugs and desirable enhancements not yet implemented.
If you fix or implement any of these please take them off the list and
remember to add an entry in ChangeLog.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS or "FEATURES":

psbasemap.c	Looks like the magnetic rose needs some alignment work(?)

pshistogram.c:	Bug using -W with time data

psxy[z]:	-Sb -So etc with time data; what is size; how to specify months etc.
		If cpt uses date-clock z-values then automatically set -f2T or -f3T.

GMT_time_array:	Should be able to handle phase shift passed from -B

testing:	Need testing of supplements at some point

gmtselect:	Should -M option cause selection by segment. I.e., if one point
		in segment passes selection, shouldn't the whole segment pass?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

gmt_init/plot..	Add TICK_LENGTH_SECONDARY (and _PRIMARY)

grd|gmtmath.c	1) Add variable support:  _var will assign stack content to variable
		var which can be used later in the expression.
		
pslegend: 	Add support for typesetting a table?

gmt_plot.c:	Different phase shifts for a, f, g?
		gridlines for x/z, y-z in 3-D (i.e. for the vertical walls in the background)
		X_AXIS_TYPE: introduce new parameter to rotate x labels?

grd2cpt.c	Knowledge of some color tables having a "hinge" at 0.  Many cpt files
		are designed with a hinge for z = 0 (e.g. bathy vs topo).  When such
		cpts are used it would be useful if programs like grd2cpt/makecpt
		could know that z = 0 (or any other special z for that matter) is such
		a hinge and that the color change at that z should still map to the
		new z = 0 even if the new zmin/zmax is not symmetric about 0.  This
		would require a flag in the CPT files, e.g. # HINGE = 0.  Several of
		our cpt files would then acquire a HINGE comment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTANCES and INCREMENTS

Goal is to harmonize the many ways we specify search radii, distances, "map units", etc.

gmtdp:		-T<tolerance>.  Also need proper spherical treatment.
grdfft:		-F units
grdfilter:	-Fwidth units and -D
grdinfo:	-M for global min/max
grdproject:	-A[k|m|n|i|c|p]
grdvolume:	-S[k] convert deg to m or km (like -M elsewhere) use -fg
greenspline:	-St lengthscale units?
project:	-Gdist[unit] -Lw[lvalues] -W[wvalues] 
pswiggle:	-M -> -fg
surface:	[-S<search_radius>[m|c]]

backtracker:	-Lb|fd_km 
originator:	-Dd_km
