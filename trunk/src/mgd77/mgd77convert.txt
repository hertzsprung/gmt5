.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmgd77convert\fP \fINGDC-ids\fP \fB\-Fa|b|t \-T\fP[\fB+\fP]\fBa|b|t\fP [ \fB\-V\fP[\fBl\fP][\fB+\fP] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmgd77convert\fP reads versions of MGD77 files and writes out the same
data in (probably) another format.
.TP
\fINGDC-ids\fP
Can be one or more MGD77 8-character NGDC cruise identifiers. To give a list of names,
use `cat cruises.lis`.  The extension will automatically be appended, if needed.
Cruise files will be looked for first in the current directory and second in all
directories listed in \fB$MGD77_DIR\fP/mgd77_paths.txt [Default location is
\fB$GMTHOME/share/mgd77\fP]. Output files are written to the current directory.
.TP
.B \-F
Specifies the format of the input (From) files.  Choose from \fBa\fP for standard
MGD77 ASCII table (with extension .mgd77), \fBb\fP for the new MGD77+ netCDF format
(with extension .nc), and \fBt\fP for a plain ASCII tab-separated table dump
(with extension .dat).
.TP
.B \-T
Specifies the format of the ounput (To) files.  Choose from \fBa\fP for standard
MGD77 ASCII table (with extension .mgd77), \fBb\fP for the new MGD77+ netCDF format
(with extension .nc), and \fBt\fP for a plain ASCII tab-separated table dump
(with extension .dat).  We will refuse to create the file(s) if they already
exist in the current directory.  Prepend \fB+\fP to override this policy.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments
#include "explain_-V.txt"
Append \fBl\fP for more details on header errors and missing fields, and append \fB+\fP
to send info to stdout [Default is stderr].

To convert 01010047.mgd77 and 01010008.mgd77 to new netCDF .nc files, and
capture all error messages, try
.br
.sp
\fBmgd77convert\fP 01010047 01010008 \fB\-Fa \-Tc \-Vl+\fP > log.lis
.br
.sp
To convert 01010047.nc to a plain ASCII table, overwriting any existing table, try

.SH OTHER TOOLS
The MGD77+ netCDF files are COARDS compliant and can be examined with general-purpose
tools such as ncBrowse and ncView.
