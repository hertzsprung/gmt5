FFT_OPT[GMT_FFT_OPT]
Choose or inquire about suitable grid dimensions for FFT and set optional parameters.
Control the FFT dimension:
.br
OPT(Nf) will force the FFT to use the actual dimensions of the data.
OPT(Nq) will inQuire about more suitable dimensions, report those, then continue.
OPT(Ns) will present a list of optional dimensions, then exit.
OPT(N)IT(nx/ny) will do FFT on array size IT(nx/ny) (must be >= grid file size).
Default chooses dimensions >= data which optimize speed and accuracy of FFT.
If FFT dimensions > grid file dimensions, data are extended and tapered to zero.
Control detrending of data:
.br
Append modifiers for removing a linear trend:
BD(+d): Detrend data, i.e. remove best-fitting linear trend [Default].
BD(+a): Only remove mean value, i.e. 0.5 * (max + min).
BD(+h): Only remove mid value, i.e. 0.5 * (max + min).
BD(+l): Leave data alone.
Control extension and tapering of data:
.br
Use modifiers to control how the extension and tapering are to be performed:
BD(+e) extends the grid by imposing edge-point symmetry [Default], BD(+m) extends
the grid by imposing edge mirror symmetry, while BD(+n) turns off data extension.
Tapering is performed from the data edge to the FFT grid edge [100%]. Change
this percentage via BD(+t)IT(width). When BD(+n) is in effect, the tapering
is applied instead to the data margins as no extension is available [0%].
Control writing of temporary results:
.br
For detailed investigation you can write the intermediate grid being passed to the
forward FFT; this is likely to have been
detrended, extended by point-symmetry along all edges, and tapered.  Append BD(+w)[IT(suffix)]
from which output file name(s) will be created (i.e., IT(ingrid)_IT(prefix).IT(ext)) [tapered],
where IT(ext) is your file extension.
Finally, you may save the complex grid produced by the forward FFT by appending BD(+z).
By default we write the real and imaginary components to IT(ingrid)_IT(real).IT(ext) and IT(ingrid)_imag.IT(ext).
Append BD(p) to save instead the polar form of magnitude and phase to files IT(ingrid)_mag.IT(ext) and IT(ingrid)_phase.IT(ext).
