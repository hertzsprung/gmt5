.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpscoast\fP plots grayshaded, colored, or textured land-masses [or water-masses] on maps and [optionally]
draws coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.  Alternatively, it can (1) issue clip paths that will
contain all land or all water areas, or (2) dump the data to an ASCII table.  The datafiles come in 5 different resolutions:
(\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, and (\fBc\fP)rude.  The full resolution files amount to more than 55 Mb
of data and provide great detail; for maps of larger geographical extent it is more economical to use
one of the other resolutions.  If the user selects to paint the land-areas and does not specify fill of
water-areas then the latter will be transparent (i.e., earlier graphics drawn in those areas will not
be overwritten).  Likewise, if the water-areas are painted and no land fill is set then the land-areas
will be transparent.  A map projection must be supplied.  The \fIPostScript\fP code is written to standard output.

.SH DATABASE INFORMATION
The coastline database is GSHHS which is compiled from two sources: World Vector Shorelines (WVS) and CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII).
In particular, all level-1 polygons (ocean-land boundary) are derived from the more accurate WVS while all higher level polygons
(level 2-4, representing land/lake, lake/island-in-lake, and island-in-lake/lake-in-island-in-lake boundaries) are
taken from WDBII.  Much processing has taken place to convert WVS and WDBII data into usable form for \fBGMT\fP:
assembling closed polygons from line segments, checking for duplicates, and correcting for crossings between
polygons.  The area of each polygon has been determined so that the user
may choose not to draw features smaller than a minimum area (see \fB\-A\fP); one may also limit the highest hierarchical level of
polygons to be included (4 is the maximum).  The 4 lower-resolution databases were derived from the full resolution
database using the Douglas-Peucker line-simplification algorithm.  The classification of rivers and borders follow
that of the WDBII.  See the \fBGMT\fP Cookbook and Technical Reference Appendix K for
further details.
.br
.sp
\fBpscoast\fP will first look for coastline files in directory \fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/coast
If the desired file is not found, it will look for the file
\fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/coastline.conf.  This file may contain any number of records that
each holds the full pathname of an alternative directory.  Comment lines (#) and blank lines
are allowed.  The desired file is then sought for in the alternate directories.
.SH BUGS
The options to fill (\fB\-C \-G \-S\fP) may not always work if the Azimuthal equidistant projection is
chosen (\fB\-Je|E\fP).  If the antipole of the projection is in the oceans it will most likely work.
If not, try to avoid using projection center coordinates that are even multiples of the coastline
bin size (1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 degrees for \fBf, h, i, l, c\fP, respectively).  This projection is
not supported for clipping.
.br
The political borders are for the most part 1970ies-style and do not reflect the recent
border rearrangements in Europe.  We intend to update these as high-resolution data become
available to us.
.br
Some users of \fBpscoast\fP will not be satisfied with what they find for the
Antarctic shoreline.  In Antarctica, the boundary between ice and 
ocean varies seasonally and inter-annually.  There are some areas of 
permanent sea ice.  In addition to these time-varying ice-ocean 
boundaries, there are also ice grounding lines where ice goes from 
floating on the sea to sitting on land, and lines delimiting areas 
of rock outcrop.  For consistency's sake, we have used the World\"'
Vector Shoreline throughout the world in pscoast, as described in
the \fBGMT\fP Cookbook Appendix K. Users who need specific boundaries
in Antarctica should get the Antarctic Digital Database, prepared
by the British Antarctic Survey, Scott Polar Research Institute,
World Conservation Monitoring Centre, under the auspices of the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.  This data base contains
various kinds of limiting lines for Antarctica and is available on
CD-ROM.  It is published by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research, Scott Polar Research Institute, Lensfield Road, Cambridge
CB2 1ER, United Kingdom.
