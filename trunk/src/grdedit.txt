.SH NAME
grdedit \- Modifying the header or content of a 2-D grid file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrdedit\fP \fIgrdfile\fP [ OPT(A) ] [ GMT_GRDEDIT ] [ OPT(E) ] 
[ OPT(N)\fIxyzfile\fP ] [ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ OPT(S) ] [ OPT(T) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] 
[ GMT_t_OPT ] [ GMT_bi_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdedit\fP reads the header information in a binary 2-D grid file and replaces
the information with values provided on the command line [if any].  As an option,
global, geographical grids (with 360 degrees longitude range) can be rotated in
the east-west direction, and individual nodal values can be replaced from a
table of \fIx, y, z\fP values.  \fBgrdedit\fP only operates on files containing a grdheader.
.TP
\fIgrdfile\fP
Name of the 2-D grid file to modify
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-A
If necessary, adjust the file's \fIx_inc, y_inc\fP to be compatible with\"'
its domain (or a new domain set with \fB\-R\fP).  Older grid files (i.e., created
prior to \fBGMT\fP 3.1) often had excessive slop in
\fIx_inc, y_inc\fP and an adjustment is necessary.  Newer files are created correctly.
.TP
.B \-D
Give new values for \fIxname, yname, zname, scale, offset, title,\fP and \fIremark\fP.
To leave some of the values untouched, specify = as the new value.
Alternatively, to allow "/" to be part of one of the values, use any non-alphanumeric
character (and not the equal sign) as separator by both starting and ending with it. For example:
\fB\-D\fP:\fIxname\fP:\fIyname\fP:\fIzname\fP:\fIscale\fP:\fIoffset\fP:\fItitle\fP:\fIremark\fP:
.TP
.B \-E
Transpose the grid and exchange the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP information.  Incompatible with the other options.
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-N
Read the ASCII (or binary; see \fB\-bi\fP) file \fIxyzfile\fP and replace the corresponding
nodal values in the grid with these \fIz\fP values.
#include "explain_-R.txt"
The new w/e/s/n values will replace those in the grid, and the \fIx_inc, y_inc\fP
values are adjusted, if necessary.
.TP
.B \-S
For global, geographical grids only.  Grid values will be shifted longitudionally according to
the new borders given in \fB\-R\fP.
.TP
.B \-T
Make necessary changes in the header to convert a gridline-registred grid to a pixel-registered
grid, or vice-versa.  Basically, gridline-registered grids will have their domain extended by
half the x- and y-increments whereas pixel-registered grids will have their domain shrunk by
the same amount.

.SH EXAMPLES
Let us assume the file data.grd covers the area 300/310/10/30.  We want
to change the boundaries from geodetic longitudes to geographic and put a new title in
the header.  We accomplish this by
.br
.sp
\fBgrdedit\fP data.grd \fB\-R\fP-60/-50/10/30 \fB\-D\fP=/=/=/=/=/"Gravity Anomalies"/=
.br
.sp
The grid world.grd has the limits 0/360/-72/72.  To shift the
data so that the limits would be -180/180/-72/72, use
.br
.sp
\fBgrdedit\fP world.grd \fB\-R\fP-180/180/-72/72 \fB\-S\fP
.br
.sp
The file junk.grd was created prior to \fBGMT\fP 3.1 with incompatible
\fB\-R\fP and \fB\-I\fP arguments.  To reset the x- and y-increments
we run
.br
.sp
\fBgrdedit\fP junk.grd \fB\-A\fP
.br
.sp
The file junk.grd was created prior to \fBGMT\fP 4.1.3 and does not contain the required
information to indicate that the grid is geographic.  To add this information, run
.br
.sp
\fBgrdedit\fP junk.grd \fB\-fg\fP
