Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT 3.3.4.
This version fixes numerous bugs.  For more details
see the Release link on the GMT web page
(http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt) and the section
on Installation.

While mostly dealing with bugfixes, a few new options
have been added to some programs in GMT 3.3.4.
grdproject now takes -C and -A (correspond to options
-C and -F in mapproject).  grdmask has new option -L
to deal with geographic data. Both grdedit and grdinfo
now support the verbose -V option.  grdimage -T,
greview -Qs, and psscale understand patterns in cptfiles.
psxy[z] have new option -Sw for pie wedges.  gmtmath
and grdmath have new functions (RAND and NRAND) to make
random numbers.  Finally, input data may contain map
coordinates such as 12:30:15W and -15:45S, and -JP with
the modifier a (-JPa) can take clockwise-oriented
azimuths rather than the default counter-clockwise
directions (-JP).

The coastline files themselves have not changed since
3.3.2 so you do not need to copy the full and high
coastlines again.  If neccesary just move them to the
3.3.4 share directory.

We now also provide a full set of *.zip files for Win32.

The latest files were updated on March 20, 2000.  As of
today (21-MAR 16:30 GMT) all mirror sites except Australia
are synced with the Hawaii server.

Sincerely,

Paul Wessel
Walter H. F. Smith
