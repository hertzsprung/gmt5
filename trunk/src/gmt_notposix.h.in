/*
 * This include file contains ifdefs that tell us if this system has
 * some of the several functions that are not part of POSIX but are
 * often distributed anyway as part of ANSI C.  The set of defines
 * below is automatically assigned by configure and determines if the
 * required functions are present or not.  These macros are then used
 * in gmt_math.h to choose between a function prototype (if found), an
 * alternative GMT function, or simply a macro.  The purpose is to
 * take advantage of the built-in functions if they exist and provide
 * alternative definitions otherwise.  For some non-Unix Operating
 * Systems, like Win32, these settings have already been hard-wired
 * into gmt_notunix.h and SET_IN_NOTUNIX is defined so we do not
 * override the system-specific settings.
