This version of x_system brings the old v 1.2 (1995?) up to full POSIX
and WIN32 compliance.  I hope to phase x_system out as x2sys becomes
fully functional; in the mean time they will both be distributed with
the supplemental GMT programs.  The GMT install will probablyl have
installed x_system already; to do it manually, say

	make all
	make install
