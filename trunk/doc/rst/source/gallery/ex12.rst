.. _example_12:

(12) Optimal triangulation of data
----------------------------------

Our next example operates on a data
set of topographic readings non-uniformly distributed in the plane
(Table 5.11 in Davis: *Statistics and Data Analysis in Geology*, J.
Wiley). We use `triangulate <../triangulate.html>`_ to
perform the optimal Delaunay triangulation, then use the output to draw
the resulting network. We label the node numbers as well as the node
values, and call `pscontour <../pscontour.html>`_ to make a
contour map and image directly from the raw data. Thus, in this example
we do not actually make grid files but still are able to contour and
image the data. We use a color palette table ``topo.cpt`` (created via
`minmax <../minmax.html>`_ and `makecpt <../makecpt.html>`_). The script becomes:
