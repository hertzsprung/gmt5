.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpsclip\fP reads (x,y) file(s) [or standard input] and draws polygons that are
activated as clipping paths.  Several files may be read to create complex paths
consisting of several non-connecting segments.
Only marks that are subsequently drawn inside the clipping path will be shown. To determine what is inside or
outside the clipping path, \fBpsclip\fP uses the even-odd rule. When a ray drawn from any point, regardless of
direction, crosses the clipping path segments an odd number of times, the point is inside the clipping path.
If the number is even, the point is outside.
The OPT(N) option, reverses the sense of what is the inside and outside of the paths by plotting a clipping
path along the map boundary.
After subsequent plotting, which will be clipped against these paths, the clipping
may be deactivated by running \fBpsclip\fP a second time with the OPT(C) option only.
.TP
\fIxyfiles\fP
ASCII [or binary, see OPT(b)] file(s) with (x,y) values for clip polygons.  If no files are given, the
standard input is read.
.TP
OPT(C)
Mark end of existing clip path.  No input file or projection information are needed.
However, you must supply OPT(Xa) and OPT(Ya) settings if you are using absolute positioning.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.sp
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
OPT(E)
Sets the viewpoint's azimuth and elevation [180/90].\"'
#include "explain_-h.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
OPT(N)
Invert the sense of what is inside and outside. For example, when using a single path, this means that
only points outside that path will be shown. Cannot be used together with OPT(B).
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
OPT(T)
Rather than read any input files, simply turn on clipping for the current map region.
Basically, OPT(T) is a convenient way to run \fBpsclip\fP with
the arguments OPT(N) /dev/null (or, under Windows, OPT(N) NUL). Cannot be used together with OPT(B).
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_-XY.txt"
.TP
OPT(Z)
For 3-D projections:  Sets the z-level of the polygons [0].
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 2 input columns].

.SH EXAMPLES
To make an overlay \fIPostScript\fP file that will set up a complex clip area to which
subsequent plotting will be confined, run:
.br
.sp
\fBpsclip\fP my_region.xy OPT(R)0/40/0/40 OPT(Jm)0.3\fBi\fP OPT(O) OPT(K) > clip_mask_on.ps
.br
.sp
To deactivate the clipping in an existing plotfile, run:
.br
.sp
\fBpsclip\fP OPT(C) OPT(O) >> complex_plot.ps
.SH BUGS
\fBpsclip\fP cannot handle polygons that contain the south or north pole.  For such polygons,
you should split them into two and make each explicitly contain the polar point.  The two
clip polygons will combine to give the desired effect.
