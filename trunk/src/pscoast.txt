.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpscoast\fP plots grayshaded, colored, or textured land-masses [or water-masses] on maps and [optionally]
draws coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.  Alternatively, it can (1) issue clip paths that will
contain all land or all water areas, or (2) dump the data to an ASCII table.  The datafiles come in 5 different resolutions:
(\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, and (\fBc\fP)rude.  The full resolution files amount to more than 55 Mb
of data and provide great detail; for maps of larger geographical extent it is more economical to use
one of the other resolutions.  If the user selects to paint the land-areas and does not specify fill of
water-areas then the latter will be transparent (i.e., earlier graphics drawn in those areas will not
be overwritten).  Likewise, if the water-areas are painted and no land fill is set then the land-areas
will be transparent.  The \fIPostScript\fP code is written to standard output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Features with an area smaller than \fImin_area\fP in km^2 or of hierarchical level that is lower than \fImin_level\fP or higher than \fImax_level\fP
will not be plotted [Default is 0/0/4 (all features)]. See DATABASE INFORMATION below for more details.
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-C
Set the shade (0\-255), color (r/g/b), or pattern (\fBp|P\fP\fIdpi/pattern\fP; see \fB\-G\fP) for lakes  [Default is the fill chosen for "wet" areas (\fB\-S\fP)].
.TP
.B \-D
Selects the resolution of the data set to use ((\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, and (\fBc\fP)rude).  The
resolution drops off by 80% between data sets. [Default is \fBl\fP].
.TP
.B \-E
Sets the viewpoint's azimuth and elevation (for perspective view) [180/90].
.TP
.B \-G
Select painting or clipping of "dry" areas.  Append a shade, color, pattern, or \fBc\fP for clipping.
#include "explain_-G.txt"
.TP
.B \-I
Draw rivers.  Specify the type of rivers and [optionally] append pen attributes  [Default pen:
width = 1, color = 0/0/0, texture = solid].  Choose from the list of river types below.
Repeat option \fB\-I\fP as often as necessary.
.br
	 1 = Permanent major rivers
.br
	 2 = Additional major rivers
.br
	 3 = Additional rivers
.br
	 4 = Minor rivers
.br
	 5 = Intermittent rivers - major
.br
	 6 = Intermittent rivers - additional
.br
	 7 = Intermittent rivers - minor
.br
	 8 = Major canals
.br
	 9 = Minor canals
.br
	10 = Irrigation canals
.br
	 a = All rivers and canals (1-10)
.br
	 r = All permanent rivers (1-4)
.br
	 i = All intermittent rivers (5-7)
.br
	 c = All canals (8-10)
.br
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Draws a simple map scale centered on \fIlon0/lat0\fP.  Use \fB\-Lx\fP to specify x/y position instead.
Scale is calculated at latitude \fIslat\fP (optionally supply longitude \fIslon\fP for oblique projections
[Default is central meridian]), \fIlength\fP is in km [miles if \fBm\fP is appended; nautical miles
if \fBn\fP is appended]. Use \fB\-Lf\fP to get a "fancy" scale [Default is plain]. The default label equals the
distance unit (km, miles, nautical miles) and is justified on top of the scale [t].  Change this by giving your
own label (or - to keep the default) and justification (l(eft), r(ight), t(op), b(ottom), and u(unit) - using
the label as a unit appended to all distance annotations along the scale).  If you want to place a rectangle
behind the scale, specify pen and/or fill parameters with the \fB+p\fP and \fB+f\fP modifiers.
.TP
.B \-M
Dumps a single multisegment ASCII (or binary, see \fB\-bo\fP) file to standard output.  No plotting occurs.
Specify any combination of \fB\-W, \-I, \-N\fP.  Optionally, you may append the
\fIflag\fP character that is written at the start of each segment header ['>'].
.TP
.B \-N
Draw political boundaries.  Specify the type of boundary and [optionally] append pen attributes  [Default pen:
width = 1, color = 0/0/0, texture = solid].  Choose from the list of boundaries below.
Repeat option \fB\-N\fP as often as necessary.
.br
	1 = National boundaries
.br
	2 = State boundaries within the Americas
.br
	3 = Marine boundaries
.br
	a = All boundaries (1-3)
.br

#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-Q
Mark end of existing clip path.  No projection information is needed.
.TP
.B \-S
Select painting or clipping of "wet" areas.  Append the shade (0\-255), color (r/g/b), pattern (see \fB\-G\fP), or \fBc\fP for clipping.
.TP
.B \-T
Draws a simple map directional rose centered on \fIlon0/lat0\fP.  Use \fB\-Lx\fP to specify x/y position instead.
The \fIsize\fP is the diameter of the rose, and the optional label information can be specified to override
the default values of W, E, S, and N.  Use \fB\-Tf\fP to get a "fancy" rose [Default is plain], and specify what
\fIkind\fP of rose you want drawn.  The default [1] draws the two principal E-W, N-S orientations, and 2 adds the
two intermediate NW-SE and NE-SW orientations, while 3 adds the eight minor orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW,
and ENE-WSW.  For Magnetic compass rose, specify \fB\-Tm\fP.  If given, \fIinfo\fP must be the two paramters
\fIdec/dlabel\fP, where \fIdec\fP is the magnetic declination and \fIdlabel\fP is a label for the magnetic compass
needle.  Then, both directions to geographic and magnetic north are plotted [Default is geographic only].  If the
north label = * then a north star is plotted instead of the north label.
Color and pen attributes are taken from COLOR_BACKGROUND and TICK_PEN, respectively, while label fonts and sizes
are the usual annotation, label, and header font settings.

.TP
.B \-W
Draw coastlines. [Default is no coastlines].  Append pen attributes  [Defaults:
width = 1, color = 0/0/0, texture = solid].

.SH DATABASE INFORMATION
The coastline database is compiled from two sources: World Vector Shorelines (WVS) and CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII).
In particular, all level-1 polygons (ocean-land boundary) are derived from the more accurate WVS while all higher level polygons
(level 2-4, representing land/lake, lake/island-in-lake, and island-in-lake/lake-in-island-in-lake boundaries) are
taken from WDBII.  Much processing has taken place to convert WVS and WDBII data into usable form for \fBGMT\fP:
assembling closed polygons from line segments, checking for duplicates, and correcting for crossings between
polygons.  The area of each polygon has been determined so that the user
may choose not to draw features smaller than a minimum area (see \fB\-A\fP); one may also limit the highest hierarchical level of
polygons to be included (4 is the maximum).  The 4 lower-resolution databases were derived from the full resolution
database using the Douglas-Peucker line-simplification algorithm.  The classification of rivers and borders follow
that of the WDBII.  See the \fBGMT\fP Cookbook and Technical Reference Appendix K for
further details.
.br
.sp
\fBpscoast\fP will first look for coastline files in directory $GMTHOME/share (where $GMTHOME is
an environmental variable).  If the desired file is not found, it will look for the file
coastline.conf in the same directory.  This file may contain any number of records that
each holds the full pathname of an alternative directory.  Comment lines (#) and blank lines
are allowed.  The desired file is then sought for in the alternate directories.
.SH BUGS
The options to fill (\fB\-C \-G \-S\fP) may not always work if the Azimuthal equidistant projection is
chosen (\fB\-Je|E\fP).  If the antipole of the projection is in the oceans it will most likely work.
If not, try to avoid using projection center coordinates that are even multiples of the coastline
bin size (1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 degrees for \fBf, h, i, l, c\fP, respectively).  This projection is
not supported for clipping.
.br
The political borders are for the most part 1970ies-style and do not reflect the recent
border rearrangements in Europe.  We intend to update these as high-resolution data become
available to us.
.br
Some users of \fBpscoast\fP will not be satisfied with what they find for the
Antarctic shoreline.  In Antarctica, the boundary between ice and 
ocean varies seasonally and interannually.  There are some areas of 
permanent sea ice.  In addition to these time-varying ice-ocean 
boundaries, there are also ice grounding lines where ice goes from 
floating on the sea to sitting on land, and lines delimiting areas 
of rock outcrop.  For consistency's sake, we have used the World
Vector Shoreline throughout the world in pscoast, as described in
the \fBGMT\fP Cookbook Appendix K. Users who need specific boundaries
in Antarctica should get the Antarctic Digital Database, prepared
by the British Antarctic Survey, Scott Polar Research Institute,
World Conservation Monitoring Centre, under the auspices of the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.  This data base contains
various kinds of limiting lines for Antarctica and is available on
CD-ROM.  It is published by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research, Scott Polar Research Institute, Lensfield Road, Cambridge
CB2 1ER, United Kingdom.
