.SH NAME
x2sys_put \- Update x2sys track data bases
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(x2sys_put) [ IT(info.tbf) ] OPT(T)IT(TAG) [ OPT(D) ] [ OPT(F) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(x2sys_put) accepts a track bin-index file created by BD(x2sys_binlist) and
adds this information about the data tracks to the relevant data base.  You may
chose to overwrite existing data with new information for older tracks (OPT(F)) and
even completely remove information for certain tracks (OPT(D)).
The x2sys IT(TAG) must match the tag encoded in the IT(info.tbf) file.  To
inquire about tracks in the data base, use BD(x2sys_get).
#include "explain_commonitems.txt"
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(info.tbf)
Name of a single track bin file.  If not given, IT(stdin) will be read.
#include "explain_tag.txt"
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(D)
Delete all tracks found in the track bin file [Default will try to add them
as new track entries].
.TP
OPT(F)
Replace any existing
database information for these tracks with the new information in the track bin file
[Default refuses to process tracks already in the database].

#include "explain_help.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To add the information stored in the track bin-index file latest.tbf to the track data bases
associated with the tag MGD77, and replace any exiting information for these tracks, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_put) latest.tbf OPT(F) OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 
.SH X2SYS DATABASES
The BD(x2sys_put) utility adds new information to the x2sys data bases.  These consists of
two files: The first file contains a listing of all the tracks that have been added to the system;
it is named IT(TAG)_tracks.d and is in ASCII format.  The second file is named IT(TAG)_index.b
and is in native binary format.  It contains information on which tracks cross each of the bins,
and what data sets were observed while crossing the bin.  The bins are defined by the OPT(R) and
OPT(I) options passed to BD(x2sys_init) when the IT(TAG) was first initiated.  Both data base
files are stored in the BD($X2SYS_HOME)/IT(TAG) directory.  Do not attempt to edit these files by hand.
