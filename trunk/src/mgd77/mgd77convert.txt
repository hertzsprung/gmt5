.TH MGD77CONVERT GMTMANSECTION DATE VERSION VERSION
.SH NAME
mgd77convert \- Translate between different formats of MGD77 files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmgd77convert\fP \fINGDC-ids\fP \fB\-Fa|b|t \-T\fP[\fB+\fP]\fBa|b|t\fP 
[ \fB\-L\fP[\fBw\fP][\fBe\fP][\fB+\fP] ] [ \fB\-V\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmgd77convert\fP reads versions of MGD77 files and writes out the same
data in (probably) another format.
#include "mgd77/explain_ncid.txt"
.TP
.B \-F
Specifies the format of the input (From) files.  Choose from \fBa\fP for standard
MGD77 ASCII table (with extension .mgd77), \fBb\fP for the new MGD77+ netCDF format
(with extension .nc), and \fBt\fP for a plain ASCII tab-separated table dump
(with extension .dat).
.TP
.B \-T
Specifies the format of the ounput (To) files.  Choose from \fBa\fP for standard
MGD77 ASCII table (with extension .mgd77), \fBb\fP for the new MGD77+ netCDF format
(with extension .nc), and \fBt\fP for a plain ASCII tab-separated table dump
(with extension .dat).  We will refuse to create the file(s) if they already
exist in the current directory.  Prepend \fB+\fP to override this policy.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-L
Set the level of verification reporting and where to send such reports.  Append
a combination of \fBw\fP for warnings, \fBe\fP for errors, and \fB+\fP to send
such log information to stdout [ Default is stderr].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To convert 01010047.mgd77 and 01010008.mgd77 to new netCDF .nc files, and
capture all verification messages, try
.br
.sp
\fBmgd77convert\fP 01010047 01010008 \fB\-Fa \-Tc \-V \-Lew+\fP > log.lis
.br
.sp
To convert 01010047.nc back to MGD77 ASCII and make sure it is identical to the
original file (here /Users/pwessel/NGDC/01010047.mgd77), try
.br
.sp
\fBmgd77convert\fP 01010047 \fB\-Fc \-Ta \-V\fP
.br
diff /Users/pwessel/NGDC/01010047.mgd77 01010047.mgd77
.br
.sp
To convert 01010047.nc to a plain ASCII table, overwriting any existing table, try
.br
.sp
\fBmgd77convert\fP 01010047 \fB\-Fc \-T+t \-V\fP
.SH FILE FORMATS
\fBmgd77convert\fP handles three different formats. (1) The MGD77 ASCII tables are
the extablished standard for distribution of underway geophysical data to and from the
NGDC data center.  Normally, only the ship-operations people and the cruise PI might
be involved in \fImaking\fP an MGD77 ASCII file for transmission to NGDC; the rest of us
are more interested in \fIreading\fP such files. (2) The MGD77+ netCDF format was
developed to fascilitate the use of MGD77 data by scientists. (3) The plain ASCII
tab-separated dump is available for users who need to manually edit the content of
a MGD77 file.  This is usually easier to do when the columns are tab-separated than
when they are all crunched together in the MGD77 punch-card format.
.SH OTHER TOOLS
The MGD77+ netCDF files are COARDS compliant and can be examined with general-purpose
tools such as ncBrowse and ncView.
