.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_init\fP initializes a set of data bases that are particular to one kind
of track data.  These data and their associated data bases are given a short-hand
notation called a system TAG.   The TAG remembers settings such as file format,
whether the data are geographic or not, and the binning resolution for track indexes.
Running \fBx2sys_init\fP is a prerequisite to running \fBx2sys_binlist\fP which will
create a crude representation of where data track go; this serves as input to
\fBx2sys_put\fP which updates the track data base. Then, \fBx2sys_get\fP can
be used to find which tracks and data are available inside a given region.
.TP
\fITAG\fP
The unique name of this data type system.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments
.TP
.B \-D
Definition file for this data set [x2sys].
.TP
.B \-E
Specifies the file extension (suffix) for these data files.  If not given we use the
definition file prefix as suffix (see \fB\-D\fP).
.TP
.B \-F
Force creating new files if old ones are present [Default will abort if old files are found].
.TP
.B \-G
Selects geographical coordinates.  Append \fBd\fP for discontinuity at the
Dateline (makes longitude go from -180 to + 180) or \fBg\fP for discontinuity
at Greenwhich (makes longitude go from 0 to 360 [Default]).
#include "explain_-I.txt"
#include "explain_-R.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Sets maximum time gap (in user units; this is typically seconds) allowed between
points on either side of a crossover [Default is Infinity].  Optionally, give a
separate distance gap (in user units; this is typically km) for those data sets
that do not have time information [Default is Infinity].
.SH EXAMPLES
If you have a large set of track data files you can organize them using the
x2sys tools.  Here we will outline the steps.  Let us assume that your track
data file format consist of 2 header records with text information followed
by any number of data records with 6 columns (lat, lon, time, obs1, obs2, obs3).
We will call this the "line" format.  First we create the line.def file:
.br
.sp
\fB\fP# Define file for the line format
.br
\fB\fP#ASCII		# File is ascii
.br
\fB\fP#SKIP 2		# Skip 2 header records
.br
\fB\fP#name	intype NaN-proxy?	NaN-proxy	scale offset oformat
.br
lon	a	N	0	1	0	%10.5lf
.br
lat	a	N	0	1	0	%9.5lf
.br
time	a	N	0	1	0	%7.1lf
.br
obs1	a	N	0	1	0	%7.2lf
.br
obs2	a	N	0	1	0	%7.2lf
.br
obs3	a	N	0	1	0	%7.2lf
.br
.sp
For ascii data the intype format is always a, Nan-proxy? should be Y
if there are certain values (e.g., -9999) that is used to represent
missing data (NaNs).  If so, the NaN-proxy values should be set
accordingly (otherwise it is ignored).  The scale and offset is
applied to the data after it is read (first scaled, then offset), 
whereas the oformat is used by some programs for formatted output.
.br
Next we create the TAG and the databases for these line track files.
Assuming these are geographic and that we want to keep track of the
data distribution at a 1 x 1 degree resolution, we may run
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_init\fP LINE \fB\-V \-G \-D\fPline \fB\-R\fP0/360/-90/90 \fB\-I\fP1/1 
.br
.sp
where we have call the tag LINE.  When x2sys tools will try to read your
line data files they will look in the file TAG_paths.txt for a list of
all the directories to examine.  Therefore, create such a file (here
LINE_paths.txt) and stick the full paths to your data directories there.
All TAG-related files will be expected to be in the directory pointed
to by \fB$X2SYS_HOME\fP.
.br
.TP
.B create tbf file(s)
Once the (empty) TAG database have been initialize we go through a two-
step process to populate them.  First we run \fBx2sys_binlist\fP on
all our track files to create one (or more) multi-segment track binindex
files (tbf).  These contain information on which 1x1 degree bins (or any
other blocksize; see \fB\-I\fP) each
track has visited and which observations (in your case obs1, obs2, obs3)
where actually observed (not all tracks may have all the kinds of
observations).  Next, the track binindex files are fed to \fBx2sys_put\fP
which will insert the information into the tag databases.
.TP
.B search
Now you may use \fBx2sys_get\fP to find all the tracks within a certain
sub-region, and optionally limit the search to those tracks that have
a particular combination of observables.
.TP
.B MGD77 or GMT
Definition files already exist for MGD77 files, the old
*.gmt files manipulated by the mgg supplements, and plain x,y,z tracks.
To initiate new track databases to be used with MGD77 data from NGDC, try
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_init\fP MGD77 \fB\-V \-D\fPmgd77 \fB\-E\fPmgd77 \fB\-Rd \-Gd \-I\fP1/1 \fB\-W\fP900/2.5
.br
.sp
where we choose a 15 minute (900 sec) or 2.5 km threshold to indicate a data gap;
the other steps are similar.
.TP
.B binary files
Let us pretend that your line files actually were binary files with a
128-byte header structure (to be skipped) followed by the data records
and where lon, lat, time are double precision numbers while the three
observations are 2-byte integers which must be multiplied by 0.1.
Finally, the first two observations may be 32000 which means there is
no data.
All that is needed is a different line.def file:
.br
.sp
\fB\fP# Define file for the line format
.br
\fB\fP#BINARY		# File is now binary
.br
\fB\fP#SKIP 128	# Skip 128 bytes
.br
\fB\fP#name	intype NaN-proxy?	NaN-proxy	scale offset oformat
.br
lon	d	N	0	1	0	%10.5lf
.br
lat	d	N	0	1	0	%9.5lf
.br
time	d	N	0	1	0	%7.1lf
.br
obs1	h	Y	32000	0.1	0	%6.1lf
.br
obs2	h	Y	32000	0.1	0	%6.1lf
.br
obs3	h	N	0	0.1	0	%6.1lf
.br
.sp
The rest of the steps are identical.  The accepted intype flags are
\fBc\fP fur signed 1-byte character (-127,+128), \fBu\fP for unsigned
byte (0-255), \fBh\fP for signed 2-byte integers (-32767,+32767),
\fBi\fP for  signed 4-byte integers (-2,147,483,647,+2,147,483,647),
\fBf\fP for 4-byte floating points and \fBd\fP for 8-byte double
precision floating points.
