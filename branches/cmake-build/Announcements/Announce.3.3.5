Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT 3.3.5.
This version fixes numerous bugs; for more details
follow the Release link on the GMT web page
(http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt).

While mostly dealing with bugfixes, a few new options
have been added to some programs in GMT 3.3.5:

1. The stereographic projection can now take -Jslon/lat/lats/1:xxxx
   for true scale at the specified standard parallel.
   
2. grd2xyz -Sr suppresses all non-NaN nodes (complements -S which
   suppresses all NaN nodes).

3. grdfilter -T toggles registration as in grdsample, but we left old
   -N in there (undocumented) to ensure backward compatibility.

4. grdtrack -Z option to only write the z-column.

5. pstext -Dj sets "smart" offsets that go in the direction of the
   text string's justification.

6. psxy[z] -Sf is now a general front plotter, with several types of
   fronts available.  The new option is backwards compatible with
   3.3.4 and earlier versions.

7. xyz2grd -An|z option to count or add up multiple node entries.

8. Added -L option to several programs that need to know if x is
   longitude (hence periodic in 360) or not (block*, triangulate,
   splitxyz.c, trend2d.c, gmtselect.c, grdtrack.c, nearneighbor.c,
   surface.c)
   
9. dbase/grdraster -Ggridfile is optional; if not given we write
   xyz triplets to stdout instead.

10. xgrid/xgridedit.c: We have added a configure script to this package
   to deal properly with the required X libraries, as well as using
   the GMT library for reading and writing grid files.

11. mex: A simple configure script obviates the need for install_gmt
    to ask user to edit the mex makefile.

We have also added many more special characters in the reencoding of
the fonts; Appendix F shows the new symbols.

A new defaults parameter, ANOT_MIN_SPACING, has been added to control
how close anotations may be plotted to each other.  The existing parameter
OBLIQUE_ANOTATION has been extended to contain numerous bit-flags that
give users more control over how anotations for oblique map projections are
handled.  By adding 10 to the value of DEGREE_FORMAT you can use the larger
degree symbol in the reencoded fonts instead of the default small ring.

The political boundary files, including *high, and *full, have been modified
to include the borders inside former Yugoslavia.

The -: option is now processed by the generic i/o routines to ensure
consistent treatment across GMT (it should only affect geographic data).
Likewise, dealing with 360-degree periodicities in longitude input is
also processed by the generic i/o functions.

The latest files were updated on July 21, 2000.  Please allow some
time for the mirror sites to obtain the latest version, and note that
the server in Norway will be down until early August.

Sincerely,
