\fINGDC-ids\fP
Can be one or more of five kinds of specifiers:
.br
1) 8-character NGDC IDs, e.g., 01010083, JA010010etc., etc.
.br
2) 2-character <agency> codes which will return all cruises from each agency.
.br
3) 4-character <agency><vessel> codes, which will return all cruises from those vessels.
.br
4) =<list>, where <list> is a table with NGDC IDs, one per line.
.br
5) If nothing is specified we return all cruises in the data base.
.br
(See mgd77info \fB\-F\fP for agency and vessel codes).
The ".mgd77" or ".nc" extensions will automatically be appended, if needed (use \fB\-I\fP
to ignore certain file types).  Cruise files will be looked for first in the current directory
and second in all directories listed in \fB$MGD77_HOME\fP/mgd77_paths.txt [If \fB$MGD77_HOME\fP
is not set it will default to \fB$GMTHOME\fP/share/mgd77].
.br
NOTE: Under Windows, only (1) and (4) are currently supported.
