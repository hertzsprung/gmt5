.SH NAME
mgd77list \- A data-extractor for <legid>.mgd77 files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmgd77list\fP \fIleg-ids\fP [ \fB\-Da\fP\fIstartdate\fP ] [ \fB\-Db\fP\fIstopdate\fP ] 
[ \fB\-E\fP ] [ \fB\-F\fP\fIflags\fP ] [ \fB\-H\fP ] [ \fB\-M\fP[\fIflag\fP] ] [ \fB\-N\fP ] 
[ \fB\-P\fP[\fIcode\fP] ][ \fB\-R\fIwest/east/south/north\fP ] [ \fB\-Sa\fP\fIstartdist\fP ] [ \fB\-Sb\fP\fIstopdist\fP ] 
[ \fB\-V\fP ] [ \fB\-W\fP\fIweight\fP ] [ \fB\-bo\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmgd77list\fP reads <legid>.mgd77 files and produces an ASCII [or binary] table.
The <legid>.mgd77 files contain track information such as time and position, geophysical
observables such as gravity, magnetics, and bathymetry, and control codes and corrections
such as Eotvos or diurnal corrections.  The user may extract any combination of these parameters
plus the computed quantities distance, heading, and velocity (\fBv\fP), and finally weight
(see \fB\-W\fP).  A sub-section can be specified by passing time- or distance-intervals along
track or by selecting a region.
.TP
\fIleg-ids\fP
Can be one or more MGD77 8-character cruise identifiers. To give a list of names, use `cat cruises.lis`.
The ".mgd77" extension will automatically be appended, if needed.  Cruise files will be looked for
in the current directory and in all directories listed in \fB$MGD77_DIR\fP/MGD77_paths.txt.

.br
.sp
In addition, the following derived quantities can be requested:
.TP
.B time
Choose between Absolute calendar time (\fBataim\fP, the default) in the format dictated by the GMT default settings  \fBOUTPUT_DATE_FORMAT\fP
and \fBOUTPUT_CLOCK_FORMAT\fP, or Relative time (\fBrtime\fP) in the format dictated by the GMT default settings  \fBD_FORMAT\fP
and \fBTIME_SYSTEM\fP (or fBTIME_EPOCH\fPand fBTIME_UNIT\fP).
.TP
.B dist
Choose between ellipsoidal, along-track distances (\fBedist\fP, the default) or quick, flat-earth approximate along-track distances (\fBfdist\fP).
Distances are reported in km (or nautical miles; see \fB\-N\fP).
.TP
.B az
Ship azimuth (heading) in degrees.
.TP
.B vel

.TP
.B weight

.br
.sp
The following short-hand flags are also recognized:
.TP
.B mgd77
This results in all 27 MGD77 fields being written out in the offical MGD77 order [Default].
.TP
.B all
In addition to the MGD77 fields, we append the 5 derived quantities listed above.
.br
.sp
Logical tests may be added for any of the parameters by appending one or more comma-separated instructions
of the form \fIpar\fP\fBOP\fP\fIvalue\fP, where \fIpar\fP is one of the parameters listed above, \fBOP\fP is
a logical operator (<. <=, =, !=, >=, >), and \fIvalue\fP is used in the comparison.  Floating point
parameters are compared numerically; character parameters are compared lexically (after leading and trailing
blanks have been removed).  At least one of the tests must be true for the record to be output, expect for
tests using UPPER case parameters in which case the test must be true for output to occur.  Note that
specifying a test does not imply that the corresponding column will be included in the output stream;
you must specify the dataflag for that to occur.
.TP
.B \-H
Issue a header record with names for each data field.
.TP
.B \-M
Issue a multisegment header record with cruise ID for each cruise.
.TP
.B \-N
Use nautical units for distance (nautical miles) and speed (knots) [Default is km and m/s].
.TP
.B \-P
Output the NGDC identifier as first column (in addition to what is set with \fB\-F\fP).  Optionally,
append a 2-character institution code.  Then, only files from this institution will be processed.
.TP
.B \-Sa
Do not list data that are less than \fIstartdist\fP km (or nautical miles; see \fB\-N\fP) along
track from port of departure. [Default is 0].
.TP
.B \-Sb
Do not list data that are more than \fIstopdist\fP km (or nautical miles; see \fB\-N\fP) along
track from port of departure. [Default is length of track].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Set the weight for these data.  Weight output option must be set in \fB\-F\fP.  This is
useful if the data are to be processed with the weighted averaging techniques offered by
\fBblockmean\fP, \fBblockmedian\fP, and \fBblockmode\fP.
.TP
.B \-Z
Append the sign you want for depth values (\fB\-Z-\fP gives negative bathymetry).
.TP
.B \-bo
Selects binary output mode (single precision; append \fBd\fP for double precision) [Default is ASCII].
\fB\-H\fP and \fB\-M\fP are ignored if \fB\-bo\fP is selected.  Likewise, string-fields cannot be selected.
