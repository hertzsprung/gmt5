.SH NAME
makecpt \- Make GMT color palette tables
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(makecpt) [ OPT(A)[BD(+)]IT(transparency) ] [ OPT(C)IT(table) ] [ OPT(D)[BD(i)|BD(o)] ]
[ OPT(F)[BD(R)|BD(r)|BD(h)|BD(c) ] [ OPT(I) ] [ OPT(M) ] [ OPT(N) ]
[ OPT(Q)[BD(i)|BD(o)] ] [ OPT(T)IT(z0)/IT(z1)[/IT(dz)[+]] | OPT(T)IT(ztable) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ]
[ OPT(W) ] [ OPT(Z) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(makecpt) is a utility that will help you make color palette tables (cpt files).  You define
an equidistant set of contour intervals or pass your own z-table, and create a new cpt file based on
an existing master cpt file.  The resulting cpt file can be reversed relative
to the master cpt, and can be made continuous or discrete.
.br
The color palette includes three additional colors beyond the range of z-values. These are
the background color (B) assigned to values lower than the lowest IT(z)-value,
the foreground color (F) assigned to values higher than the highest IT(z)-value,
and the NaN color (N) painted whereever values are undefined.
.br
If the master cpt file includes B, F, and N entries, these will be copied into the new master file.
If not, the parameters BD(COLOR_BACKGROUND), BD(COLOR_FOREGROUND), and BD(COLOR_NAN) from
the BD(gmt.conf) file or the command line will be used. This default behavior can be overruled
using the options OPT(D), OPT(M) or OPT(N).
.br
The color model (RGB, HSV or CMYK) of the palette created by BD(makecpt) will be the same as
specified in the header of the master cpt file. When there is no BD(COLOR_MODEL) entry in the
master cpt file, the BD(COLOR_MODEL) specified in the BD(gmt.conf) file or on the command line
will be used.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
None.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(A)[BD(+)]IT(transparency)
Sets a constant level of transparency (0\-100) for all color slices.  Prepend BD(+) to also
affect the fore-, back-, and nan-colors [Default is no transparency, i.e., 0 (opaque)].
.TP
OPT(C)IT(table)
Selects the master color table IT(table) to use in the interpolation.
Choose among the built-in tables (type BD(makecpt) to see the list) or
give the name of an existing cpt file [Default gives a rainbow cpt file].
.TP
OPT(D)[BD(i)|BD(o)]
Select the back- and foreground colors to match the colors for lowest and highest IT(z)-values
in the output cpt file [Default uses the colors specified in the master file, or those defined by 
the parameters BD(COLOR_BACKGROUND), BD(COLOR_FOREGROUND), and BD(COLOR_NAN)].
Append BD(i) to match the colors for the lowest and highest values in the input (instead of the output) cpt file.
.TP
OPT(F)[BD(R)|BD(r)|BD(h)|BD(c)]
Force output cpt file to written with r/g/b codes, gray-scale values or color name (BD(R), default)
or r/g/b codes only (BD(r)), or h-s-v codes (BD(h)), or c/m/y/k codes (BD(c)).
.TP
OPT(I)
Reverses the sense of color progression in the master cpt file.
Also exchanges the foreground and background colors, including those specified by
the parameters BD(COLOR_BACKGROUND) and BD(COLOR_FOREGROUND).
.TP
OPT(M)
Overrule background, foreground, and NaN colors specified in the master cpt file with the values of
the parameters BD(COLOR_BACKGROUND), BD(COLOR_FOREGROUND), and BD(COLOR_NAN) specified in
the BD(gmt.conf) file or on the command line.
When combined with OPT(D), only BD(COLOR_NAN) is considered.
.TP
OPT(N)
Do not write out the background, foreground, and NaN-color fields [Default will write them].
.TP
OPT(Q)[BD(i)|BD(o)]
Selects a logarithmic interpolation scheme [Default is linear].  OPT(Qi)
expects input z-values to be log10(z), assigns colors, and writes out z
[Default].  OPT(Qo) takes log10(z) first, assigns colors, and writes out z.
.TP
OPT(T)IT(z0)/IT(z1)[/IT(dz)[+]] | OPT(T)IT(ztable)
Defines the range of the new cpt file by giving the lowest and highest z-value and interval.
When used with OPT(C) and IT(dz) is not specified, the number of intervals remains the same as in the input palette.
If IT(dz) is specified with a trailing '+' we interpret IT(dz) as the number of desired intervals instead. 
Alternatively, give the name of a ASCII file that has one z-value per record.
If OPT(T) is not given, the existing range in the master cpt file will be used intact.

.TP
OPT(W)
Do not interpolate the input color table but pick the output colors starting at the beginning of the map.
This is particularly useful in combination with a categorical color table. Cannot be used in combination with OPT(Z).
.TP
OPT(Z)
Creates a continuous cpt file [Default is discontinuous, i.e., constant colors
for each interval].

.SH EXAMPLES
To make a cpt file with z-values from -200 to 200, with discrete color changes every
25, and using a polar blue-white-red colortable:
.br
.sp
makecpt -Cpolar -T-200/200/25 > colors.cpt
.br
.sp
To make an equidistant cpt file from z = -2 to 6, in steps of 1, using
continuous default rainbow colors:
.br
.sp
makecpt -T-2/6/1 -Z > rainbow.cpt
.br
.sp
To make a GEBCO look-alike cpt file for bathymetry, run
.br
.sp
makecpt -Cgebco > my_gebco.cpt
.SH BUGS
Since BD(makecpt) will also interpolate from any existing .cpt file you
may have in your directory, you cannot use one of the listed cpt names
as an output filename; hence the my_gebco.cpt in the example.
