Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.5.7.
This stable release mostly fixes several bugs and is recommended
for all GMT users.  For a complete list of enhancements and
features, please see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference
& Cookbook or follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).  Windows users should be aware that
the Windows binaries are now both (32 & 64 bits) build with GDAL support.

As of today, all but the Japan  and S Africa mirror
ftp servers are now synced up; we hope those three will follow
within 24 hours.  Alternatively, OS X users will soon find
GMT 4.5.7 in Fink's 'unstable' tree.

We continue to work on the GMT5, the next generation of GMT,
which we hope to release in beta version this summer and for
final release as 5.0.0 in October, 2011.
For more information about GMT 5 and who should consider trying
it out, please visit gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/5.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
