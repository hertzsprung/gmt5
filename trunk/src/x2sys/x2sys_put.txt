.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_put\fP accepts a track bin-index file created by \fBx2sys_binlist\fP and
adds this information about the data tracks to the relevant data base.
The system \fITAG\fP must match the tag encoded in the \fIinfo.tbf\fP file.  To
inquire about tracks in the data base, use \fBx2sys_get\fP.
.TP

No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
\fIinfo.tbf\fP
Name of a single track bin file.  If not given, stdin will be read.
.TP
.B \-S
Used to swap bytes when reading the binary records.  Because the flat binary
database is written using native binary fwrite, you may have to use this option
if you are reading a file created with a different endianness.  The updated
file is always written with the current endianness.
