GMT_B_OPT
Set map boundary annotation and tickmark intervals. The format of IT(tickinfo) is
[BD(p)|BD(s)]IT(xinfo)[/IT(yinfo)[/IT(zinfo)]][BD(:.)"Title"BD(:)][BD(W)|BD(w)][BD(E)|BD(e)][BD(S)|BD(s)][BD(N)|BD(n)][BD(Z)|BD(z)[BD(+)]][BD(+g)IT(fill)].
The leading BD(p) [Default] or BD(s) selects the primary or secondary annotation information.
Each of the IT(?info) segments are textstrings of the form
IT(info)[BD(:)"Axis label"BD(:)][BD(:=)"prefix"BD(:)][\fB:,\fP"unit label"BD(:)].
The IT(info) string is made up of one or more concatenated substrings of the form
[BD(a)|BD(f)|BD(g)][IT(stride)[+-IT(phase)][IT(unit)]].
The leading BD(a) is used to specify the annotation and major tick spacing [Default], BD(f) for minor tick spacing, and
BD(g) for gridline spacing (when IT(stride) in omitted, gridline spacing is the same as the annotation spacing).
IT(stride) is the desired stride interval. 
The optional IT(phase) shifts the annotation interval by that amount (positive or negative).
The optional IT(unit) indicates the unit of the IT(stride) and can be any of
BD(Y) (year, plot with 4 digits), BD(y) (year, plot with 2 digits), BD(O) (month, plot using BD(FORMAT_DATE_MAP)),
BD(o) (month, plot with 2 digits), BD(U) (ISO week, plot using BD(FORMAT_DATE_MAP)), BD(u) (ISO week, plot using 2 digits),
BD(r) (Gregorian week, 7-day stride from start of week BD(TIME_WEEK_START)), BD(K) (ISO weekday, plot name of day),
BD(D) (date, plot using BD(FORMAT_DATE_MAP)), BD(d) (day, plot day of month 0-31 or year 1-366, via BD(FORMAT_DATE_MAP)),
BD(R) (day, same as BD(d), aligned with BD(TIME_WEEK_START)), BD(H) (hour, plot using BD(FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP)),
BD(h) (hour, plot with 2 digits), BD(M) (minute, plot using BD(FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP)), BD(m) (minute, plot with 2 digits), 
BD(S) (second, plot using BD(FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP)), BD(s) (second, plot with 2 digits).  Note for geographic axes
BD(m) and BD(s) instead mean arc minutes and arc seconds.  All entities that are language-specific are under control
by BD(TIME_LANGUAGE).
.br
Alternatively, for linear maps, we can omit IT(stride), thus setting IT(xinfo), IT(yinfo), or IT(zinfo) to
BD(a) automatically determines the annotation interval,
BD(af) adds suitable minor tick intervals,
BD(g) plots grid lines with the same interval as if OPT(Ba) was used,
BD(ag) plots both annotation and grid lines with the same spacing,
BD(afg) adds suitable minor tick intervals.
.br
For custom annotations and intervals, let IT(xinfo), IT(yinfo), or IT(zinfo) be
BD(c)IT(intfile), where IT(intfile) contains any number
of records with IT(coord) IT(type) [IT(label)].  Here, IT(type) is one or more letters from BD(a)|BD(i), BD(f), and BD(g).
For BD(a)|BD(i) you must supply a IT(label) that will be plotted at the IT(coord) location.
To specify separate x and y ticks, separate the substrings that apply to the x and y
axes with a slash [/] (If a 3-D basemap is selected with OPT(p) and OPT(Jz), a third substring pertaining
to the vertical axis may be appended.)  For linear/log/power projections (OPT(Jx)|BD(X)): Labels
for each axis can be added by surrounding them with colons (BD(:)).  If the first character in the
label is a period, then the label is used as plot title; if it is a comma (\fB,\fP) then the label is
appended to each annotation; if it is an equal sign (BD(=)) the the prefix is prepended to each annotation (start label/prefix
with - to avoid space between annotation and item); else it is the axis label.
If the label consists of more than one word, enclose the entire label in double quotes (e.g.,
BD(:)"my label"BD(:)).
If you need to use a colon (:) as part of your label you must specify it using its octal code (\\072).
If you want to plot just the map boundary and nothing else, OPT(B)0 suffices.
.br
By default, all 4 boundaries are plotted (referred to as BD(W), BD(E), BD(S), BD(N)).  To change the default,
append the code for only those axes you want (e.g., BD(WS) for standard lower-left x- and y-axis system).
Upper case (e.g., BD(W)) means draw axis/tickmarks AND annotate it, whereas lower case
(e.g., BD(w)) will only draw axis/tickmarks.  If ONLY s is appended, separate it with a comma to avoid
its interpretation as the unit of second.  If a 3-D basemap is selected with OPT(p) and
OPT(Jz), append BD(Z) or BD(z) to control the appearance
of the vertical axis.  Append BD(+) to draw the outline of the cube defined by OPT(R).  Note
that for 3-D views the title, if given, will be suppressed.  Finally, to paint the inside of the
map region, append BD(+g)IT(fill) [no fill].
.br
For non-geographical projections:
Give negative scale (in OPT(Jx)) or axis length (in OPT(JX)) to change the direction
of increasing coordinates (i.e., to make the y-axis positive down).  For log10 axes:  Annotations
can be specified in one of three ways:  (1) IT(stride) can be 1, 2, 3, or -IT(n).  Annotations will then
occur at 1, 1\-2\-5, or 1\-2\-3\-4\-...\-9, respectively; for -IT(n) we annotate every IT(n)'t magnitude.
This option can also be used for
the frame and grid intervals.  (2) An BD(l) is appended to the IT(tickinfo) string.
Then, log10 of the tick value is plotted at every integer log10 value.  (3) A BD(p) is appended
to the IT(tickinfo) string.  Then, annotations appear as 10 raised to log10 of the tick value.
For power axes: Annotations can be specified in one of two ways:  (1) IT(stride) sets the
regular annotation interval.  (2) A BD(p) is appended to the IT(tickinfo) string.  Then,
the annotation interval is expected to be in transformed units, but the annotation value
will be plotted as untransformed units.  E.g., if IT(stride) = 1 and IT(power) = 0.5 (i.e., sqrt),
then equidistant annotations labeled 1\-4\-9... will appear.
