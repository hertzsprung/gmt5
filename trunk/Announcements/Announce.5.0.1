Dear GMT user-

Today, we are pleased to announce two new releases of GMT:

  * GMT 5.0.1  - The next generation of GMT
  * GMT 4.5.10 - The latest stable GMT 4 version

At the same time, we update the GSHHG geography data set to 2.2.4;
this release adds missing lakes to California and a few other fixes.

The change, improvements, and enhancements in GMT 5 are much too
numerous for this short email; see our article published in EOS
on Tuesday, Nov. 5 via http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013EO450001.
Also, see the new documentation on http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu.
Please note that bug reports and feature requests should now be
posted via our website and not via email to all GMT users.

Despite extensive testing, GMT 5 is likely to be less stable than
GMT 4, at least initially, hence we recommend that GMT users install
both versions and switch between them using gmtswitch as needed.


Sincerely,

The GMT Team
