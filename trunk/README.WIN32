README file for GMT 4 Distribution for Win32
This version contains dynamic executables with the DLL support.

INSTALLATION:
=============

To use GMT on your system you must

1. Install netCDF.  You can either compile from source or get
   precompiled binaries.  See www.unidata.ucar.edu's netcdf page
   for details and ftp links.  There is also a .zip file on the
   GMT ftp sites.

2a Win95/98/Me:
   Edit SRC/GMTENV.BAT and change the values for GMTHOME, HOME, and NETCDF
   if your setup differs from what these defaults values indicate.
   Execute GMTENV.BAT or place it in autoexec.bat so it is run each
   time you reboot your machine.

2b WinNT/2000/XP:
   Add GMTHOME, HOME, and NETCDF, and modify PATH, LIB, INCLUDE in the
   environmental parameters via the system settings.  See the gmtenv.bat
   file for what the definitions should be.

3. To test that all is well, try some of the commands in the cookbook.
   As of version 4, we no longer maintain DOS-versions of examples.
   You are strongly urged to install the free Services For Unix from
   Microsoft or Cygwin from RedHat to take full advantage of GMT.


ADDITIONAL MATERIAL:
====================

For complete GMT Documentation, including a Cookbook and Technical
Reference Manual, a Tutorial and Short Course Manual in PDF format,
and a PDF version of all UNIX man pages, get the GMT_pdf.zip archive.
For the HTML-only versions, get GMT_web.zip.  After installing, make
a bookmark for the file GMT/www/gmt/gmt_sevices.html.  Should you
want to try the tutorial examples you will need GMT_tut.zip.
PostScript version of the documentation is in GMT_ps.zip and the
UNIX man pages are in GMT_man.zip.  Most Windows users will only
need the HTML or PDF versions.

If you want the high and/or full resolution coastlines, political borders,
and rivers you must obtain GMT_high.zip and GMT_full.zip as well.
unzip from the directory that contains GMT.

To view your GMT PostScript or EPS plots, we recommend you install gsview
(see www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview). It is required to run the do_view script.
