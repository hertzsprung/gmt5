OPT(T)
Draws a simple map directional rose centered on \fIlon0/lat0\fP.  Use OPT(Tx) to specify x/y position instead.
The \fIsize\fP is the diameter of the rose, and optional label information can be specified to override
the default values of W, E, S, and N (Give \fB::\fP to suppress all labels).  The default [plain] map rose only labels north.  Use
OPT(Tf) to get a
"fancy" rose, and specify what \fIkind\fP of rose you want drawn.  The default [1] draws the two principal E-W,
N-S orientations, 2 adds the two intermediate NW-SE and NE-SW orientations, while 3 adds the eight minor
orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW.  For a magnetic compass rose, specify OPT(Tm).  If given,
\fIinfo\fP must be the two parameters \fIdec/dlabel\fP, where \fIdec\fP is the magnetic declination and \fIdlabel\fP
is a label for the magnetic compass needle (specify \fB-\fP to format a label from \fIdec\fP).  Then, both directions
to geographic and magnetic north are plotted [Default is geographic only].  If the north label is \fB*\fP then a north
star is plotted instead of the north label.  Annotation and two levels of tick intervals for geographic and magnetic
directions are 10/5/1 and 30/5/1 degrees, respectively; override these settings by appending \fB+\fP\fIgints\fP[/\fImints\fP].
Color and pen attributes are taken from \fBCOLOR_BACKGROUND\fP and \fBTICK_PEN\fP, respectively, while label fonts and sizes
follow the usual annotation, label, and header font settings.
