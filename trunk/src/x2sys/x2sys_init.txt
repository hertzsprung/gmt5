x2sys_init \- Initialize data baes for track data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_init\fP \fITAG\fP [ \fB\-D\fP\fIdeffile\fP ] [ \fB\-F\fP ] 
[ \fB\-Gd|g\fP ] [ \fB\-I\fP\fIdx\fP[\fIdy\fP] ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_init\fP initializes a set of data base that are particular to on kind
of track data.  These data and their associated data bases are given a short-hand
notation called a system TAG.   The TAG remembers settings such as file format,
if the data are geographic, and the binning resolution for track indexes.  Running
\fBx2sys_init\fP is a prerequisite to running \fBx2sys_binlist\fP which will create
a crude representation of where data track go.
.TP
\fITAG\fP
The unique name of this data type system.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments
.TP
.B \-D
Definition file for this data set. [x2sys.def]
.TP
.B \-G
Selects geographical coordinates.  Append \fBd\fP for discontinuity at the
Dateline (makes longitude go from -180 to + 180) or \fBg\fP for discontinuity
at Greenwhich (makes longitude go from 0 to 360 [Default]).

.TP
.B \-W
Sets maximum time gap (in user units) allowed between points on either
side of a crossover [Default is Infinity].
