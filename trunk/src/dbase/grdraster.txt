.TH GRDRASTER GMTMANSECTION DATE VERSION VERSION
.SH NAME
grdraster \- extract subregion from a binary raster and write a grd file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrdraster\fP [ \fIfilenumber\fP ] \fB\-R\fP\fIwest/east/south/north\fP[\fBr\fP] 
[ \fB\-G\fP\fIgrdfilename\fP ] [ \fB\-I\fP\fIx_inc\fP[\fBm|c\fP][/\fIy_inc\fP[\fBm|c\fP]] ] 
[ \fB\-J\fP\fIparams\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] [ \fB\-bo\fP[\fBs\fP] ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdraster\fP reads a file called \fIgrdraster.info\fP from the directory  
pointed to by the environment parameter $GMT_GRIDDIR (if this parameter is
not set it defaults to $GMTHOME/share/dbase).  The info file defines binary
arrays of data stored in scan-line format in data files.  Each file is given
a \fIfilenumber\fP in the info file.  \fBgrdraster\fP figures out how to
load the raster data into a grd file spanning a region defined by \fB\-R\fP.
By default the grid spacing equals the raster spacing.  The \fB\-I\fP option
may be used to sub-sample the raster data.  No filtering or interpolating is
done, however; the \fIx_inc\fP and \fIy_inc\fP of the grd file must be
multiples of the increments of the raster file and \fBgrdraster\fP simply 
takes every n'th point.  The output of \fBgrdraster\fP is either grid or\"'
pixel registered depending on the registration of the raster used.  It is up
to the \fBGMT\fP system person to maintain the \fIgrdraster.info\fP file in
accordance with the available rasters at each site.  Raster data sets are
not supplied with \fBGMT\fP but can be obtained by anonymous ftp and on 
CD-ROM (see README page in dbase directory).  \fBgrdraster\fP will list the
available files if no arguments are given.  Finally, \fBgrdraster\fP will
write xyz-triplets to stdout if no output gridfile name is given
.TP
\fIfilenumber\fP
An integer matching one of the files listed in the \fIgrdraster.info\fP file.

#include "explain_-R.txt"
If \fBr\fP is appended, you may also specify a map projection to define the shape of
your region.  The output region will be rounded off to the nearest whole grid-step
in both dimensions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-G
Name of output grid file.  If not set, the grid will be written as ASCII
(or binary; see \fB\-bo\fP xyz-triplets to stdout instead.
#include "explain_-I.txt"
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_-o_binary.txt"
This option applies only if no \fB\-G\fP option has been set.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To extract data from raster 1, taking one point every 30 minutes, in an 
area extended beyond 360 degrees to allow later filtering, run

.br
.sp
To obtain data for an oblique Mercator projection we need to extract more data
that is actually used.  This is necessary because the output of \fBgrdraster\fP has edges defined by
parallels and meridians, while the oblique map in general does not.  Hence, to
get all the data from data set 3 needed to make a contour map for the region defined by its
lower left and upper right corners and the desired projection, use
