Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce two new updates for GMT:

  * GMT 5.1.1  - The latest GMT 5 with bug fixes since 5.1.0
  * GMT 4.5.12 - The latest GMT 4 with bug fixes since 4.5.11

These two updates were released on March 1, 2014.

Last month the GSHHG geography data set was updated to 2.3.0,
replacing the old and inaccurate Antarctica coastline with
new data from the Atlas of the Cryosphere.
Also, the DCW country polygons were updated to 1.1.1.

For specific changes in either GMT version see the online
documentations on the two websites.

As of this announcement, all ftp mirrors appear synced up.
OS X users will soon find both GMT versions in, Fink, MacPorts,
and HomeBrew.  Linux users may have to build from
source until their package managers pick up the new releases.
Windows installers are provided by us, as usual.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
