GMT_X_OPT GMT_Y_OPT
Shift plot origin relative to the current origin by (IT(x-shift),IT(y-shift)) and
optionally append the length unit (BD(c), BD(i), or BD(p)).
You can
prepend BD(a) to shift the origin back to the original position after plotting,
prepend BD(c) to center the plot on the center of the paper (optionally add shift),
prepend BD(f) to shift the origin relative to the fixed lower left corner of the page, or
prepend BD(r) [Default] to move the origin relative to its current location.
If OPT(O) is used then the default (IT(x-shift),IT(y-shift)) is (r0), otherwise it is (r1i).
When OPT(X) or OPT(Y) are used without any further arguments, the values from the last use of that option
in a previous BD(GMT) command will be used.
