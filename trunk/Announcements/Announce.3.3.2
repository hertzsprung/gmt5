Dear GMT user-                     24-SEPT-1999

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT
Version 3.3.2.  This version fixes several bad
bugs that were introduced in 3.3.1 this summer,
as well as many older bugs.  It also makes a
few minor changes, in particular with respect to
the SI/US settings.  This is now entirely a
run-time selection, while in the past the final
executables would be slightly different for SI
and US.  For copyright reasons we have also made
Watson's triangulation routine the default, while
the faster, but copyrighted, routine by Shewchuck
is now an option.

A new supplemental package (segyprogs) has been
added.  It allows plotting of SEGY seismic data
profiles, and is maintained by Tim Henstock.

The WIN32 executables are still static, but now
works for all the 19 examples (ex 3 not ported yet).
GMT now offer binary i/o redirect under Win32.

GMT 3.3.2 has now been ported to OS/2, thanks to
Allen Cogbill, LANL.

For more detailed information, see the document

Details can be found in the CHANGES file in the
distribution.
