	   We are imagining a ray extending "up" from the
	   point (xp,yp); the ray has equation x = xp, y >= yp.
	   Starting with crossing_count = 0, we add 1 each time
	   the path crosses the ray in the +x direction, and
	   subtract 1 each time the ray crosses in the -x direction.
	   After traversing the entire polygon, if (crossing_count)
	   then point is inside.  We also watch for edge conditions.

	   If two or more points on the path have x[i] == xp, then
	   we have an ambiguous case, and we have to find the points
	   in the path before and after this section, and check them.
