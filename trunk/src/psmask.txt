.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpsmask\fP reads a (x,y,z) file [or standard input] and uses this information to find out
which grid cells are reliable.  Only gridcells which have one or more data points are considered
reliable.  As an option, you may specify a radius of influence. Then, all gridcells that are
within \fIradius\fP of a data point are considered reliable.  Furthermore, an option is provided to
reverse the sense of the test.  Having found the reliable/not reliable points, \fBpsmask\fP will
either paint tiles to mask these nodes (with the \fB\-T\fP) switch, or use contouring to create
polygons that will clip out regions of no interest.  When clipping is initiated, it will stay in
effect until turned off by a second call to \fBpsmask\fP using the \fB\-C\fP option.
.TP
\fIxyzfile\fP
File with (x,y,z) values (e.g., that was used to run \fBsurface\fP).  If no file
is given, standard input is read.  For binary files, see \fB\-b\fP.
#include "explain_-I.txt"
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
#include "explain_-R.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.sp
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-C
Mark end of existing clip path.  No input file is needed.  Implicitly sets \fB\-O\fP.
.TP
.B \-D
Dumps out the resulting clipping polygons to disk.  Ignored if \fB\-T\fP is set.
If no dumpprefix is given we use mask (Files will be called mask_*.d).
.TP
.B \-E
Sets the viewpoint's azimuth and elevation for perspective plots [180/90].\"'
.TP
.B \-F
Force pixel registration.  [Default is grid registration].
.TP
.B \-G
Paint the clip polygons [or tiles] with selected fill [Default is no fill].
#include "explain_-G_nopattern.txt"
#include "explain_-H.txt"
Not used with binary data.
#include "explain_-K.txt"
#include "explain_-M.txt"
.TP
.B \-N
Invert the sense of the test, i.e. clip regions where there is data coverage.
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-S
Sets radius of influence. Grid nodes within \fIradius\fP of a data point are considered reliable. [Default is 0, which
means that only grid cells with data in them are reliable].  Append \fBk\fP to indicate km,
also implying that \fB\-R\fP and \fB\-I\fP are in degrees.
.TP
.B \-T
Plot tiles instead of clip polygons (Only works with \fB\-Jx\fP, \fB\-Jj\fP, \fB\-Jm\fP, \fB\-Jq\fP, and \fB\-Jy\fP).
Use \fB\-G\fP to set tile color.

#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_-XY.txt"

[Default is 2 input columns].

.SH EXAMPLES
To make an overlay \fIPostScript\fP file that will mask out the regions of a contour map
where there is no control data using clip polygons, use:
