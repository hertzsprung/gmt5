.TP
\fINGDC-ids\fP
Can be one or more MGD77 8-character cruise identifiers. To give a list of names, use `cat cruises.lis`.
The ".mgd77" or ".nc" extensions will automatically be appended, if needed (use \fB\-I\fP
to ignore certain file types).  Cruise files will be looked for first in the current directory
and second in all directories listed in \fB$MGD77_HOME\fP/mgd77_paths.txt [If \fB$MGD77_HOME\fP
is not set it will default to \fB$GMTHOME\fP/share/mgd77].
