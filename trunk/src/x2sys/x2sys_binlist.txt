.SH NAME
x2sys_binlist \- Create bin-index files from track data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP \fItrack(s)\fP OPT(T)\fITAG\fP 
[ OPT(D) ] [ OPT(E) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP reads one or more track data files and produces a
multi-segment ASCII track bin-index file (tbf) with the track name in the header and
one data record per bin crossed; these records contain \fIlon, lat, index, flags\fP[, \fIdist\fP],
where \fIlon, lat\fP are the coordinates of the center of the bin, the \fIindex\fP is
the 1-D number of the bin, and \fIflags\fP is a bitflag that describes which data
fields were available in this bin.  The optional \fIdist\fP requires OPT(D).
The input files can be of any format, which must be described and passed with the
OPT(T) option.  The bin-index listing is a crude representation of where
the track goes and is used by the data archivist to build an x2sys track data base for
miscellaneous track queries, such as when needing to determine which tracks
should be compared in a crossover analysis.  You must run \fBx2ys_init\fP
to initialize the tag before you can run the indexing.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-D
Calculate the length of trackline segments per bin [Default skips this step].
The length fragments are given as the 5th output column (after the \fIflags\fP).
The length units are obtained via the TAB setting (see \fBx2sys_init\fP).
.TP
.B \-E
Convert geographic data to a cylindrical equal-area projection prior to binning.  Basically, we
apply the projection OPT(JY)\fIlon0\fP/37:04:17.166076/360, where \fIlon0\fP is the
mid-longitude of the region.  Requires OPT(D), geographical data, and a global region
(e.g., OPT(Rg) or OPT(Rd)).  This option is useful for statistics related to trackline
density but should not be used when preparing bin-index files for the x2sys track data bases.

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a bin index file from the MGD77 file 01030061.mgd77 using the settings associated
with the tag MGD77, do
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP 01030061.mgd77 \fB\-T\fPMGD77 > 01030061.tbf
.br
.sp
To create a track bin index file of all MGD77+ files residing in the current directory
using the settings associated with the tag MGD77+ and calculate track distances, run
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP *.nc \fB\-T\fPMGD77+ \-D\fP > all.tbf
