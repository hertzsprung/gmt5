.TP
OPT(E)IT(rotfile)
Give file with rotation parameters.  This file must contain
one record for each rotation; each record must be of the following format:
.br
.sp
    IT(lon lat tstart [tstop] angle) [ IT(khat a b c d e f g df) ]
.br
.sp
where IT(tstart) and IT(tstop) are in Myr and IT(lon lat angle) are in degrees.
IT(tstart) and IT(tstop) are the ages of the old and young ends of a stage.  If IT(tstop)
is not present in the record then a total reconstruction rotation is expected and IT(tstop) is implicitly set to 0 and
should not be specified for any of the records in the file.  If a covariance matrix BD(C) for the rotation is available
it must be specified in a format using the nine optional terms listed in brackets.
Here, BD(C) = (IT(g)/IT(khat))*[ IT(a b d; b c e; d e f) ] which shows BD(C)
made up of three row vectors.
If the degrees of freedom (IT(df)) in fitting the rotation is 0 or not given it is set to 10000.
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
You may prepend a leading + to the filename to indicate you wish to invert the rotations.
.br
Alternatively, give the filename composed of two plate IDs separated by a hyphen (e.g., PAC-MBL)
and we will instead extract that rotation from the GPlates rotation database.  We return an error
if the rotation cannot be found.
