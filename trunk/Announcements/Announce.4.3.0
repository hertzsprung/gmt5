Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.3.0.
For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook online
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).  GMT 4.3.0 is a recommended
upgrade for all users.  It also is required if you plan to
take advantage of GMT's 64-bit support or use GMT with Octave.
GMT 4.3.0 also uses the revised GSHHS v.1.10 coastlines. We
now also distribute Windows Installers rather than zip files.

At this point, the two European site and the NOAA mirror have
synced up, and we expect the others to follow within 24 hours.
We are also pleased to announce a new Australia mirror at the
University of Sydney.


Sincerely,

The GMT Team
