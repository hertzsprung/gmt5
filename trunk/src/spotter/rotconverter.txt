.SH NAME
rotconverter \- Manipulate finite and stage rotations 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrotconverter\fP [+][-] \fIrotA\fP [ [+|- \fIrotB\fP ] [ +|- \fIrotC\fP ] ... \fB\-D 
\-F\fP\fIin/out\fP \fB\-N \-S \-V\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrotconverter\fP reads one or more plate motion models (rotations) stored in the
given files.  If more than one plate motion model is given we will add or subtract
them in the order they were listed.  The minus sign means we should first transpose the
rotation and then add it to the previous rotation.  The input files must all be of the
same type (stage poles or finite rotations) which may differ from the desired output
format; see \fB\-F\fP.  If a file cannot be open we will attempt to decode the file name
as a rotation whose parameters are separated by slashes.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIrotX\fP
Name of a file with a plate motion model.  Separate several files with desired operator
(+ or -).  The very first file may also have a leading minus to imply a transpose.
If any of the specified rotation models cannot be opened as a file, we will try to decode
the file name as \fIlon/lat/tstart\fP[\fI/tstop\fP]/\fIangle\fP for a single rotation given
on the command line.  The \fItstop\fP argument is required for stage poles only.  For a
finite rotation without any time information, give \fIlon/lat/angle\fP only.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-D
Report longitudes use the -180/+180 range [Default is 0/360].
.TP
.B \-F
Specify both the input and output format for rotations.  The \fIin\fP and \fIout\fP flags
must be either \fBf\fP or \fBs\fP for finite or stage rotations, respectively.  Note that
both must be specified if \fB\-F\fP is set [Default is \fB\-Fff\fP (both input and output
are finite rotations)].
.TP
.B \-N
Place all output poles in the northern hemisphere [Default reports positive rotation angles].
.TP
.B \-S
Place all output poles in the southern hemisphere [Default reports positive rotation angles].
.TP
.B \-V
Verbose option: Report statistics of extracted rotations [Default is silent].
.SH EXAMPLES
To convert the finite rotations in the file model_finite.APM to stage poles, run
.br
.sp
rotconverter model_finite.APM \fB\-Ffs\fP > model_stages.APM
.br
.sp
To obtain Nazca motion relative to Pacific hotspots by adding the motion
of Nazca relative to a fixed Pacific to the Pacific-Hotspot reference model DC85_stages.d,
and report the result as finite reconstruction poles in the northern hemisphere, try
.br
.sp
rotconverter DC85_stages.APM + Pac_Naz_stages.RPM \fB\-N \-Fsf\fP > Naz_HS_finite.APM
.br
.sp
To add the final rotations ROT(150.1, 70.5, -20.3) and ROT (145.0, 40.0, 11.4), give dummy
start times 1 and try
.br
.sp
rotconverter 150.1/70.5/1/-20.3 + 145/40/1/11.4
.sp
.br
which prints out 157.32, -80.44, 11.97.
