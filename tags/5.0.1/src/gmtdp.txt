.SH NAME
gmtdp \- Line reduction using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(gmtdp) [ IT(table) ] OPT(T)IT(tolerance)[IT(unit)] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ] [ GMT_b_OPT ] [ GMT_bo_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ] [ GMT_g_OPT ]  [ GMT_h_OPT ] [ GMT_i_OPT ] [ GMT_o_OPT ] [ GMT_colon_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(gmtdp) reads one or more data files
and apply the Douglas-Peucker line simplification algorithm. The method recursively 
subdivides a polygon until a run of points can be replaced by a straight line segment, 
with no point in that run deviating from the straight line by more than the tolerance.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(T)IT(tolerance)[IT(unit)]
Specifies the maximum mismatch tolerance in the user units.  If the data is
not Cartesian then append the distance unit (see UNITS).

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To reduce the geographic line segment.d using a tolerance of 2 km, run 
.br
.sp
gmtdp segment.d -T2k > new_segment.d
.br
.sp
To reduce the Cartesian lines xylines.d using a tolerance of 0.45
and write the reduced lines to file new_xylines.d, run 
.br
.sp
gmtdp xylines.d -T0.45 > new_xylines.d
.SH BUGS
One known issue with the Douglas-Peucker has to do with crossovers.
Specifically, it cannot be guaranteed that the reduced line does
not cross itself.  Depending on how many lines you are considering
it is also possible that reduced lines may intersect other reduced lines.
Finally, the current implementation only does Flat Earth calculations even if
you specify spherical; BD(gmtdp) will issue a warning and reset the
calculation mode to Flat Earth.
