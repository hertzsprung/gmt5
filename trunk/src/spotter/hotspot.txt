.TP
.B \-F
Give file with hotspot locations.  This file must contain
one record for each hotspot to be considered; each record must be of the
following format:
.br
.sp
	lon lat hs_abbrev hs_id r t_off t_on create fit plot name
.br
.sp
E.g., for Hawaii this may look like
.br
.sp
205	20	HWI	1	25	0	90	Y	Y	Y	Hawaii
.br
.sp
Most applications only need the first 4 columns which thus represents the minimal
hotspot information record type.  The abbreviation may be maximum 3 characters long.
The id must be an integer from 1-32.  The positional uncertainty of the hotspot is
given by r (in km).  The t_off and t_on variables are used to indicate the active
time-span of the hotspot.  The create, fit, and plot indicators are either Y or N and
are used by some programs to indicate if the hotspot is included in the ID-grids used
to determine rotations, if the hotspot chain will be used to determine rotations, and
if the hotspot should be included in various plots.  The name is a 32-character maximum
text string with the full hotspot name.
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
