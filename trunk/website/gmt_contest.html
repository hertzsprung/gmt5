<H3>Rationale</H3>
Given that GMT5 will be released in the first half of 2012, we think it is time to retire the old GMT logo and timestamp (above)  and
get new ones.  We would like the GMT community to help with this and we propose a Logo and Timestamp
competition.  First let us define what these items are meant to be and how they are used:
<UL>
<LI>The GMT <b>Logo</b> is a color graphics suitable to put on posters, KeyNote/PowerPoint presentations, and documentation.
	We currently use the logo on our web page and on the cover pages of the documentation.  Because it
	is typically used at a reasonable size (e.g., 1 inch high by 2 inch wide or 2.5cm by 5 cm) it can be moderately
	detailed and of high resolution.  GMT4 comes with a script called <b>gmtlogo</b> that produces PostScript code
	that can be used to overlay the logo on a plot (i.e., it has -O -K set).
<LI>The GMT <b>Timestamp</b> is a small graphic item plotted on GMT maps when the <b>-U</b> option is used.  Currently,
	it is a very small 90 x 220 pixels B/W bit-map image that is plotted at 600 dpi, thus having dimensions of
	approximately 0.15 inch by 0.365 inch (3.8 mm by 9.3 mm).  Because of the small size it cannot be too detailed, i.e., it
	cannot just be a scaled-down version of the Logo as details will get lost.
	GMT will place a date/time string to the right of the graphics, as controlled by <b>-U</b>.
</UL>
There are a few guidelines that all entries have to abide by:
<UL><LI>The GMT <b>Logo</b>:
	<OL>
		<LI>The logo must be created by a GMT 5 sh or bash script called gmt5logo which must have the following usage:<br>
		    gmt5logo dx dy scale [-Gbackground] [-Wboxpen] >> t.ps<br>
		   For an closer explanation of options, see the current GMT4 gmtlogo man page.  The script must use GMT 5 syntax; you
		   can model your script based on the old version.
		<LI>The script cannot involve a very time-consuming calculation or rendering or depend on a very large data set.
		<LI>Any data set used to generate the logo must be in the public domain so it can be included in GMT 5.
		<LI>The logo should be artistic but also represent an aspect that GMT excels in.
	</OL>  
<LI>The GMT <b>Timestamp</b>:			
	<OL>
		<LI>You may create this in any way you like (it does not have to be a GMT script). The submission should be a PNG file with dimensions 90 pixels tall
			and 220 pixels wide [The <b>-U</b> option will place this graphics when the winning entry is implemented].
		<LI>The graphics can be in color but should also reproduce adequately when printed on black/white laserwriters.
	</OL>
</UL>
There is NO requirement that you must submit entries for both the logo and the timestamp, and there is NO requirement
that the timestamp graphic be a miniaturized version of the logo.  You may submit more than one entry in each category.
<H3>Submission and Deadlines</H3>
	Submit your entries to <A HREF="mailto:pwessel@hawaii.edu">Paul Wessel</A>; make sure you attach any data sets needed
	to run your script (for binary or large files, please attach as tbz or zip archives).  <b>The deadline is flexible but will be announced at least a month or two before it is finalized!</b>.
<H3>Determining the winning entries</H3>
	We will arrange for a vote after the deadline.  We will render all entries and set up a webpage where you can cast your votes.  The result of
	the vote will be announced a few days prior to the release of GMT 5 which is anticipated in the first half of 2012.
<H3>Copyright, etc.</H3>
	By submitting an entry you are basically giving up all rights to the script or PNG.  Specifically, you are giving the GMT team the right to use and distribute your script or image as part of the GMT distribution.  The GMT team may modify your script to make it more efficient, shorter, and to better comply with GMT syntax but will not alter the result.
	Any data set needed to run the script will be incorporated into the GMT distribution and therefore must be in the public domain.
	The GMT Documentation will acknowledge the author of the logo, as will the gmt5logo usage message and man page.  You are also giving us
	the right to use the graphics on items like T-shirts or coffee mugs without further compensation.
<H3>Prizes</H3>
The winning Logo entry will receive a white T-shirt with his/her logo on the front, and there will be runner-up prizes as well!
