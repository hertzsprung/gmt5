.TH PS2RASTER 1 MANDATE GMT_STRING "Generic Mapping Tools"
.SH NAME
ps2raster \- Converts one or several \fIPostScript\fP file(s) to other formats using GhostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBps2raster\fP \fIpsfile(s)\fP [ OPT(A)[\fBu\fP] ] [ OPT(D)\fIoutdir\fP ] [ OPT(E)\fIresolution\fP ] [ OPT(G)\fIghost_path\fP ] 
[ OPT(L)\fIlistfile\fP]  [ OPT(P) ] [ OPT(S) ] [ OPT(Te)|\fBf\fP|\fBj\fP|\fBg\fP|\fBm\fP|\fBt\fP ] [ OPT(V) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBps2raster\fP reads one or more \fIPostScript\fP files (or a file with a list of \fIPostScript\fP filenames) and modifies the
page size in order that the resulting image will have a size determined by the BoundingBox (or HiResBoundingBox, if present).
As an option, a tight HiResBoundingBox may be computed first.
.TP
\fIpsfiles\fP
Names of \fIPostScript\fP files to be converted. The output files will have the same name but with the
conventional extension name associated to the raster format (e.g. .jpg for the jpeg format).  Use
OPT(D) to redirect the output to a different directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Adjust the BoundingBox and HiResBoundingBox to the minimum required by the image content.  Append \fBu\fP to first remove any
GMT-produced time-stamps.
.TP
.B \-D
Sets an alternative output directory (which must exist) [Default is the same directory as the PS files].
Use OPT(D.) to place the output in the current directory instead.
.TP
.B \-E
Set raster resolution in dpi [default = 720 for PDF, 300 for others].
.TP
.B \-G
Full path to your ghostscript executable.
NOTE: For Unix systems this is generally not necessary.
However, under Windows, GhostScript is not added to the system's path. So either you do it yourself,\"'
or give the full path here. (e.g., \fB\-G\fPc:\\programs\\gs\\gs7.05\\bin\\gswin32c).
.TP
.B \-L
The \fIlistfile\fP is an ASCII file with the names of the \fIPostScript\fP files to be converted.
.TP
.B \-N
This option is obsolete.
Use OPT(S) to print the ghostscript command, if applicable.
Use OPT(Te) to save the intermediate EPS file.
.TP
.B \-P
Force Portrait mode. All Landscape mode plots will be rotated back so that they show unrotated in
Portrait mode. This is practical when converting to image formats or preparing EPS or PDF plots for
inclusion in documents.
.TP
.B \-S
Print to standard output the ghostscript command after it has been executed.
.TP
.B \-T
Sets the output format, where \fBe\fP means EPS, \fBf\fP means PDF, \fBj\fP means JPEG, \fBg\fP means PNG,
\fBG\fP means transparent PNG (untouched regions are transparent), \fBm\fP means PPM, and \fBt\fP means TIF [default is JPEG].
The EPS format can be combined with any of the other formats. For example, OPT(Tef) creates both an EPS and
a PDF file.
.TP
.B \-V
Run in verbose mode and report on progress [Default is silent].
.SH NOTES
The conversion to raster images (JPEG, PNG, PPM or TIF) inherently results in loss of details that are
available in the original \fIPostScript\fP file. Choose a resolution that is large enough for the application that
the image will be used for. For web pages, smaller dpi values suffice, for Word documents and PowerPoint presentations
a higher dpi value is recommended. \fBps2raster\fP uses the loss-less Flate compression technique when
creating JPEG, PNG and TIF images.
.br
.sp
EPS is a vector, not a raster format. Therefore, the \fB-E\fP option has no effect on the creation
of EPS files. Using the option \fB-Te\fP will remove PageSize commands from the \fIPostScript\fP file and will
adjust the BoundingBox when the \fB-A\fP option is used.  Note the original and required BoundingBox is limited
to integer points, hence Adobe added the optional HiResBoundingBox to add more precision in sizing.  The OPT(A)
option calculates both and writes both to the EPS file used in the rasterization (and output if OPT(Te) is set).
.br
.sp
Although PDF is also a vector format, the \fB-E\fP option has an effect on the resolution of pattern fills
and fonts that are stored as bitmaps in the document. \fBps2raster\fP therefore uses a larger default
resolution when creating PDF files. In order to obtain high-quality PDF files, the \fI/prepress\fP options
are in effect, allowing only loss-less compression of raster images embedded in the \fIPostScript\fP file.

See Appendix C of the \fBGMT Technical Reference and Cookbook\fP for more information on how
\fBps2raster\fP is used to produce graphics that can be inserted into other documents (articles, presentations,
posters, etc.).
.SH EXAMPLE
To convert a the file psfile.ps to PNG using a tight BoundingBox and rotating it back to normal
orientation in case it was in Landscape mode:
.br
.sp
\fBps2raster\fP psfile.ps \fB\-A \-P \-Tg\fP
.br
.sp
(This command assumes that ghostscript can be found in your system's path.)\"'
