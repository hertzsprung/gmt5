.B \-B
Sets map boundary tickmark intervals. \fItickinfo\fP is a textstring made up of one or more
concatenated substrings of the form [\fBitem\fP]\fIstride\fP[\fBunit\fP].  The optional \fBitem\fP
identifies a particular axis item.  Three axis item types exist (six for time-axis, which may also
use \fBA\fP, \fBI\fP, and \fBi\fP):
.br
.sp
	\fBa\fP: (upper) tick annotation stride (upper means annotations closest to the axis)
.br
	\fBf\fP: (upper) frame tick stride.
.br
	\fBg\fP: grid line stride.
.br
	\fBA\fP: lower tick annotation stride (lower means annotations farthest from the axis).
.br
	\fBi\fP: upper interval annotation stride (interval means annotation is centered on the interval).
.br
	\fBI\fP: lower interval annotation stride.
.br
	   \fBi\fP or \fBI\fP may be immediately followed by \fImod\fP which controls interval annotations:
.br
         f: Annotate full calendar-item name (e.g., "January").
.br
         a: Annotate abbreviated calendar-item name (e.g., "Jan").
.br
         c: Annotate 1-char calendar-item name (e.g., "J").
.br
	   Use F, A, C to force upper case annotation.
.br
	If \fBitem\fP is not given, it defaults to \fBa\fP (upper tick annotations).
.br
	If frame tick stride is not set, it is assumed to be the same as the upper annotation stride.
.br
.sp
	The optional \fBunit\fP modifies \fIstride\fP accordingly.
.br
	For maps, you may use
.br
        m: arc minutes [Default unit is degree].
.br
        c: arc seconds.
.br
	For time axes, several units are recognized:
.br
        Y: year - plot using all 4 digits.
.br
        y: year - plot only last 2 digits.
.br
        O: month - format annotation according to PLOT_DATE_FORMAT.;
.br
        o: month - plot as 2-digit integer (1-12).
.br
        U: ISO week - format annotation according to PLOT_DATE_FORMAT.
.br
        u: ISO week - plot as 2-digit integer (1-53).
.br
        r: Gregorian week - 7-day stride from chosen start of week (Sunday).
.br
        K: ISO weekday - format annotation according to PLOT_DATE_FORMAT.
.br
        k: weekday - plot name of weekdays in selected language [English].
.br
        D: day  - format annotation according to PLOT_DATE_FORMAT, which also determines whether
we should plot day of month (1-31) or day of year (1-366).
.br
        d: day - plot as 2- (day of month) or 3- (day of year) integer.
.br
        H: hour - format annotation according to PLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT.
.br
        h: hour - plot as 2-digit integer (0-23).
.br
        M: minute - format annotation according to PLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT.
.br
        m: minute - plot as 2-digit integer (0-59).
.br
        C: second - format annotation according to PLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT.
.br
        c: second - plot as 2-digit integer (0-59; 60-61 if leap seconds are enabled).
.br
.sp
Specify an axis label by surrounding it with colons (e.g., :"my x label":).
Note that all labels that contain spaces must be quoted.
.br
To append a unit to each annotation (e.g., 5 km, 10 km ...) add a label that begins
with a comma; the rest is used as unit annotation (e.g. :",km":). If the unit has
a leading hyphen (-) there will be no space between unit and annotation (e.g., :,-%:).
.br
For separate x and y [and z if -Jz is used] tickinfo, separate the strings with slashes [/].
.br
Specify an plot title by adding a label whose first character is a period; the rest
of the label is used as the title (e.g. :".My Plot Title":).
.br
By default, all 4 boundaries are plotted (referred to as \fBW, E, S, N\fP).  To change the default,
append the code for only those axes you want (e.g., \fBWS\fP for standard lower-left x- and y-axis system).
Upper case (e.g., \fBW\fP) means draw axis/tickmarks AND annotate it, whereas lower case
(e.g., \fBw\fP) will only draw axis/tickmarks.  (If a 3-D basemap is selected with \fB\-E\fP and
\fB\-Jz\fP, append \fBZ\fP or \fBz\fP to control the appearance
of the vertical axis.  Append '+' to draw the outline of the cube defined by \fB\-R\fP.  Note
that for 3-D views the title, if given, will be suppressed.)
.br
Log10 axis: Append \fBl\fP to annotate log10 (x) or \fBp\fP for 10^(log10(x)) [Default annotates x].
Power axis: append \fBp\fP to annotate x at equidistant pow increments [Default will yield nonlinear
spacing between annotations due to the nonlinear projection].

.br
For non-geographical projections:
Give negative scale (in \fB\-Jx\fP) or axis length (in \fB\-JX\fP) to change the direction
of increasing coordinates (i.e., to make the y-axis positive down).  For log10 axes:  Annotations
can be specified in one of three ways:  (1) \fIstride\fP can be 1, 2, or 3.  Annotations will then
occur at 1, 1\-2\-5, or 1\-2\-3\-4\-...\-9, respectively.  This option can also be used for
the frame and grid intervals.  (2) An \fBl\fP (lower case L) may be appended to the \fItickinfo\fP string.
Then, log10 of the tick value is plotted at every integer log10 value.  (3) A \fBp\fP may be appended
to the \fItickinfo\fP string.  Then, annotations appear as 10 raised to log10 of the tick value.
For power axes: Annotations can be specified in one of two ways:  (1) \fIstride\fP sets the
regular annotation interval.  (2) A \fBp\fP is appended to the \fItickinfo\fP string.  Then,
the annotation interval is expected to be in transformed units, but the annotation value
will be plotted as untransformed units.  E.g., if \fIstride\fP = 1 and \fIpower\fP = 0.5 (i.e., sqrt),
then equidistant annotations labeled 1\-4\-9... will appear.
.br
These \fBGMT\fP parameters can affect the appearance of the map boundary: ANNOT_MIN_ANGLE, ANNOT_MIN_SPACING,
ANNOT_FONT, ANNOT_FONT_SIZE, ANNOT_OFFSET, BASEMAP_AXES, BASEMAP_FRAME_RGB, BASEMAP_TYPE, DEGREE_SYMBOL,
FRAME_PEN, FRAME_WIDTH, GRID_CROSS_SIZE, GRID_PEN, HEADER_FON, HEADER_FONT_SIZE, LABEL_FONT,
LABEL_FONT_SIZE, LINE_STEP, OBLIQUE_ANNOTATION, PLOT_DEGREE_FORMAT, TICK_LENGTH, TICK_PEN, and Y_AXIS_TYPE.  In addition,
time axes can also be affected by:  ANNOT_FONT2, ANNOT_FONT2_SIZE, ANNOT_OFFSET2, PLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT, PLOT_DATE_FORMAT,
TIME_LANGUAGE, and TIME_WEEK_START; see the \fBgmtdefaults\fP man page for details.
