Two electronic mailing lists are available for users to subscribe to.
<OL>
<LI><B>gmt-help@hawaii.edu</B> provides a forum
for GMT users to exchange ideas and ask questions about GMT usage,
installation, portability, etc. Please use this utility rather than
sending questions directly to us;
you are much more likely to get a speedy reply.
<LI><B>gmt-group@hawaii.edu</B> is a one-way street
for us to notify users when a new version has been released. No user
can post to this list.  Please subscribe to this list if you ONLY
want email when a new version is available.
</OL>

To add yourself to these mailinglist (maintained by the listproc
program), send email to <A HREF="mailto:listproc@hawaii.edu">listproc@hawaii.edu</A>
with a one-line message. E.g., if your name is John Smith then send

<P><B>subscribe gmt-help John Smith</B>

<P>Listproc automatically obtains your email address.  To unsubscribe, send
<P><B>unsubscribe gmt-help</B>
<P>
instead.  The same procedure is used for <B>gmt-group</B>.
<P>
To browse previously posted messages, Stephan Eickschen (eickschen.haenel@t-online.de)
maintains a <A HREF="http://wegener.mechanik.tu-darmstadt.de/GMT-Help/">GMT Mailing List Archive</A>.
gmt-help is also available as a readonly netnews group via NNTP as
gis.gmtlist at server <A HREF="news://news2.sinica.edu.tw">news2.sinica.edu.tw</A>.

<P>Occasionally, a frustrated new GMT user will convince him/herself
that their work is so important that they are justified in digging up our
phone numbers and calling us directly to get personal attention to their
problem. Please don't even <B>think</B> about doing this unless you are
prepared to pay our standard consulting fee of USD 200 per hour...
