Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.5.0.
This release fixes several problems but also adds much new
functionality; it is therefore a highly recommended upgrade
from 4.4.0.

New tools in the misc and imgsrc supplements, as well as
improvements to ps2raster, allow users to prepare rich KML
files for Google Earth.  We also add a new supplement (sph)
for triangulation and interpolation on a sphere, relying on
R. Renka's published source code.  Finally, we issue a much
improved GSHHS, now at version 2.0.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

As of this notice, the Oslo, NOAA, SOEST, Sydney, and Brazil
ftp servers are now updated; the others will follow within
24 hours (we hope).

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
