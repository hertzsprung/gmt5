.SH GEOGRAPHICAL AND TIME COORDINATES
When the output grid type is netCDF, the coordinates will be labeled "longitude", "latitude", or "time" based on the
attributes of the input data or grid (if any) or on the
OPT(f) or OPT(R) options. For example, both OPT(f0x) OPT(f1t) and OPT(R)90w/90e/0t/3t will result in a longitude/time
grid. When the x, y, or z coordinate is time, it will be stored in the grid as relative time since epoch as 
specified by \fBTIME_UNIT\fP and \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP in the \.gmtdefaults file or on the command line.
In addition, the \fBunit\fP attribute of the time variable will indicate both this unit and epoch.
