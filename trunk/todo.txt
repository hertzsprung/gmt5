List of unresolved bugs and desireable enhancements not yet implemented.
If you fix or implement any of these please take them off the list and
remember to add an entry in CHANGES.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS or "FEATURES":

Makefile:	Do we need both GNUmakefile and Makefile?

gmt_init.c	The whole .gmtcommands4 history thing. Under Pauls OSX there
		were issues in job08.csh where the order misfired. Long term:
		(1) GMT5 will need to deactivate this mechanism when used as API
		(2) Order of access to .gmtcommands4 cannot be guaranteed. How
		    do we work around that?
		    
gmt_plot.c: 	- Treatment of tick lengths and offsets not consistent.
		- time or geo not supported for z-axis
		- 3D time axis not properly annotated.
		- No annotations for Gnomonic projection
		
minmax.c:	Bug using -I with time data.  The -I option does not offer
		any time-intervals such as month, year, weeks etc.  At the
		moment you must use -I30.4167 to get an average month interval.
		Some of the necessary machinery for this exist in the context
		of plot annotations but the GMT_getinc parser is not used
		for that.

psbasemap.c	Looks like the magnetic rose needs some alignment work(?)

pshistogram.c:	Bug using -W with time data

psxy[z]:	-Sb -So etc with time data; what is size; how to specify months etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

GIS supplement:	In src/gis, finalize grd2geotiff.c donated from K. Feigl.  Needs work
		on configure and finding libs.  This supplement should also have Lloyd's
		shapefile converter.
		
*.c:		Use Chunk = GMT_CHUNK; n_alloc += Chunk, Chunk *= 2; to rachet up
		allocation for large data sets.

grd|gmtmath.c	1) Add macro support; macros defined in .gmtmath or passed via -D
		2) Add variable support:  _var will assign stack content to variable
		var which can be used later in the expression.
		
pslegend: 	Add support for typesetting a table?

gmt_plot.c:	Different phase shifts for a, f, g?
		gridlines for x/z, y-z in 3-D (ie. for the vertical walls in the background)
		X_AXIS_TYPE: introduce new parameter to rotate x labels?

grd2xyz.c	Knowledge of some color tables having a "hinge" at 0.  Many cpt files
		are designed with a hinge for z = 0 (e.g. bathy vs topo).  When such
		cpts are used it would be useful if programs like grd2cpt/makecpt
		could know that z = 0 (or any other special z for that matter) is such
		a hinge and that the color change at that z should still map to the
		new z = 0 even if the new zmin/zmax is not symmetric about 0.  This
		would require a flag in the CPT files, e.g. # HINGE = 0.  Several of
		our cpt files would then acquire a HINGE comment.

met:		Supplement with wind barb solution and other symbols.  There are lots
		of meteorology symbols out there - perhaps starting off with a tool
		that can hande the barbs is a good start.

psscale:	Add 3-D view option.  Add 3-D view [Need to reclaim the -E option
		for -Eaz/el but allow backwards comp for current -E option.  Rename
		current -E option as -T.  Also reclaim -Z for setting the z-level
		for 3-D views and move current -Z to -W for bar widths; process
		-Z<file> still for backwardness.

geotiff:	Kurt Feigl has contributed a grd2geotiff.c program but it is mostly
		based on grdimage that I can imagine we could add this extensive
		feature as an option to grdimage.  There is also some shapefile
		support that Lloyd wrote that needs to be finalized; perhaps these
		two things could go into a "gis" supplement.
