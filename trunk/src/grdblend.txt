.SH NAME
grdblend \- Blend several partially over-lapping grids into one large grid
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrdblend\fP \fIblendfile\fP OPT(G)\fIgrdfile\fP GMT_I_OPT GMT_Rgeo_OPT 
[ OPT(N)\fInodata\fP ] [ OPT(Q) ] [ OPT(Z)\fIscale\fP ] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ] [ OPT(W) ] [ GMT_fi_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdblend\fP reads a listing of gridded files and blend parameters and
creates a binary grdfile by blending the other grids using cosine-taper weights.
\fBgrdblend\fP will report if some of the nodes are not filled in with
data.  Such unconstrained nodes are set to a value specified by the user [Default is NaN].
Nodes with more than one value will be set to the weighted average value.
.TP
\fIblendfile\fP
ASCII file with one record per grid file to include in the blend.  Each record must contain the gridfile name,
the \fB\-R\fP-setting for the interior region, and the relative weight \fIwr\fP, separated by spaces or tabs.
In the combined weighting scheme, this grid will be given weight = zero outside its domain, weight = \fIwr\fP
inside the interior region, and a 2-D cosine-tapered weight between those end-members in the boundary strip.
However, if a negative \fIwr\fP is given then the sense of tapering is inverted (i.e., zero weight inside its
domain).
If the ASCII file is not given \fBgrdblend\fP will read standard input.
.TP
.B \-G
\fIgrdfile\fP is the name of the binary output grdfile.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-N
No data.  Set nodes with no input grid to this value [Default is NaN].
.TP
.B \-Q
Create a header-less gridfile suitable for use with \fBgrdraster\fP.  Requires that the output gridfile
is a native format (i.e., not netCDF).
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Do not blend, just output the weights used for each node.  This option is valid when only one
input grid is provided [Default makes the blend].
.TP
.B \-Z
Scale output values by \fIscale\fP before writing to file. [1].

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a grdfile from the four gridded files piece_?.grd, make the blendfile like this
.br
.sp
piece_1.grd	-R<subregion_1> 1
.br
piece_2.grd	-R<subregion_2> 1
.br
piece_3.grd	-R<subregion_3> 1
.br
piece_4.grd	-R<subregion_4> 1
.br
.sp
Then run
.br
.sp
\fBgrdblend\fP blend.job \fB\-G\fPblend.grd \fB\-R\fP<full_region> \fB\-I\fP<dx/dy> \fB-V\fP
