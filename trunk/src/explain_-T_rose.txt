Draws a simple map directional rose centered on \fIlon0/lat0\fP.  Use \fB\-Lx\fP to specify x/y position instead.
The \fIsize\fP is the diameter of the rose, and the optional label information can be specified to override
the default values of W, E, S, and N.  Use \fB\-Tf\fP to get a "fancy" rose [Default is plain], and specify what
\fIkind\fP of rose you want drawn.  The default [1] draws the two principal E-W, N-S orientations, and 2 adds the
two intermediate NW-SE and NE-SW orientations, while 3 adds the eight minor orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW,
and ENE-WSW.  For Magnetic compass rose, specify \fB\-Tm\fP.  If given, \fIinfo\fP must be the two paramters
\fIdec/dlabel\fP, where \fIdec\fP is the magnetic declination and \fIdlabel\fP is a label for the magnetic compass
needle.  Then, both directions to geographic and magnetic north are plotted [Default is geographic only].  If the
north label = * then a north star is plotted instead of the north label.  Annotation interval for geographic and
magnetic directions are 10 and 30 degrees, respectively; override these settings by appending +\fIgint\fP[/\fImint\fP].
Color and pen attributes are taken from COLOR_BACKGROUND and TICK_PEN, respectively, while label fonts and sizes
are the usual annotation, label, and header font settings.
