GMT_X_OPT GMT_Y_OPT
Shift plot origin relative to the current origin by (IT(x-shift),IT(y-shift)) and
optionally append the length unit (BD(c), BD(i), or BD(p)).
You can prepend BD(a) to shift the origin back to the original position after plotting,
or prepend  BD(r) [Default] to reset the current origin to the new location.
If OPT(O) is used then the default (IT(x-shift),IT(y-shift)) is (0,0), otherwise it is
(r1i, r1i) or (r2.5c, r2.5c).
Alternatively, give BD(c) to align the center coordinate (x or y) of the plot with the center of the page
based on current page size.
When OPT(X) or OPT(Y) are used without any further arguments, the values from the last use of that option
in a previous BD(GMT) command will be used.
