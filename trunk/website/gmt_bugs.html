<h3><center>17-OCT-2000: GMT Version 3.3.6 Released</h3></center>
<HR><P>
This page contains links to pieces of GMT source that have been updated
in response to bug reports, and in some cases due to minor enhancements.
No documentation of such enhancements will be available until the next
release.

<h4>Libraries and include files</h4>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt_io.c">gmt_io.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/22/2000.  We revert our policy and allow -: to work on any kind of data, just as pre-3.3.4.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt_support.c">gmt_support.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/22/2000.  Use Mika Heiskanen's binary search for cpt index, which speeds up grdview/image for large cpt files.</LI>
<LI>12/08/2000.  When D_FORMAT was not %lg, we format to check if a unit string should be added.</LI>
<LI>11/28/2000.  While preparing the boundary conditions, the test for xrange
being a multiple of xinc could fail due to a bug in the test.</LI>
<LI>10/30/2000.  GMT_getinc, which parses the -Idx/dy options for grid spacings,
would temporarily remove any trailing m or c (for minute or seconds) and not put
it back when done.  Thus, the command string in output gridfiles would
show a slighlty incorrect command line,  e.g., it would say -I2 instead of -I2m.
The grid interval was correctly set so this is just a cosmetic issue.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt_map.c">gmt_map.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/09/2000.  Made grdproject give bogus 2nd message about search radius.</LI>
<LI>12/08/2000.  Must add 360 if both west and east are negative.</LI>
<LI>12/05/2000.  There should be no Gnomonic annotations except for rectangular regions.</LI>
<LI>11/05/2000.  The -JX<width>d projection is a special version of linear with built-in
knowledge of the 360-degree periodicity.  Unfortunately, the inverse projection was not
properly implemented; this bug only seems to have affected the z-axis on 3-D basemaps.</LI>
<LI>10/20/2000.  A _very_ densily sampled track crossing a map boundary could run
into a GMT-roundoff situation where a crossing is first detected but later
discarded - resulting in a missing "pen down" instruction (and hence a PostScript violation).  The fix is to
use the pre-round-off coordinates to decide whether to discard or not.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt.h">gmt.h</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/08/2000.  Added a parameter needed for 3-D basemaps.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt_init.h">gmt_init.h</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/08/2000.  Added a parameter needed for 3-D basemaps.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt_plot.c">gmt_plot.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/08/2000.  Minor changes to ensure the user could specify a custom D_FORMAT _and_ us -B,<unit>
at the same time.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt_shore.c">gmt_shore.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/03/2000.  A problem arises in pscoast when -A is used with a minimum size
larger than zero.  The levels of the bin nodes are based on -A0 but that can change
if another cutoff is used.  This occasionally results in bad behavior.  The fix improves
this situation alot but it is not a complete fix.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmt_io.c">gmt_io.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>10/20/2000.  Parsing of -Z did check for errors but did not notify users
why it failed - thus grd2xyz would produce an empty output file and no error messages.
This is more of a 'documentation' issue than a real bug, though.</LI>
</OL>
</UL>
<HR>
<h4>Individual programs</h4>
<LI><A HREF="errata/minmax.c">minmax.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/15/2000.  Added option -L for geographical data.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/psxy.c">psxy.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/09/2000.  -SE will work for points that are outside map but whose ellipse may clip the map.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/psxyz.c">psxyz.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/09/2000.  -SE will work for points that are outside map but whose ellipse may clip the map.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/psscale.c">psscale.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/08/2000.  Now, -B0 will plot no anotations at all.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/pswiggle.c">pswiggle.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/07/2000.  Positive anomaly was not always painted in the preferred direction.</LI>
<LI>11/17/2000.  The -Z option assumed values were given in inches unless a modifier was appended.
However, it should instead check what the default measure unit is set to (MEASURE_UNIT).</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/mapproject.c">mapproject.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/05/2000.  Wrong units sometimes used when reporting xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax; however the output
coordinates were always correct.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/pscoast.c">pscoast.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>12/05/2000.  Had world_map = TRUE for Gnomonic, which is not correct, and this
could lead to criss-crossing lines across the map.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/grdvector.c">grdvector.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>11/30/2000.  Added -Sl option to specify a fixed length for all vectors.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/grdinfo2.c">mex/grdinfo2.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>11/17/2000.  If the file was not found, the exit return would shut down Matlab.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/grdread.c">mex/grdread.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>11/17/2000.  If the file was not found, the exit return would shut down Matlab.</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/gmttrack.c">mgg/gmttrack.c</A>
<OL>
<LI>11/03/2000.  The -Sa -Sb options did not convert km to meters so km was
compared to meters internally.  Wrong loop variable used to initialize distance (this
only affected runs with -Sa, -Sb).</LI>
</OL>
<LI><A HREF="errata/img2grd">img2grd</A>
<OL>
<LI>10/30/2000.  Would fail if -V were not given.</LI>
</OL>
</UL>
These bug fixes will be incorporated into the next release.
