.SH NAME
splitxyz \- filter to divide (x,y,z[,distance,heading]) data into (x,y,z) track segments.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsplitxyz\fP [ \fIxyz[dh]file\fP ] \fB\-C\fP\fIcourse_change\fP [ \fB\-A\fP\fIazimuth\fP/\fItolerance\fP ] 
[ \fB\-D\fP\fIminimum_distance\fP ] [ \fB\-F\fP\fIxy_filter\fP/\fIz_filter\fP ] [ \fB\-G\fP\fIgap_distance\fP ] 
[ \fB\-H\fP[\fInrec\fP] ] [ \fB\-M\fP ] [ \fB\-N\fP\fInamestem\fP ] [ \fB\-S\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] [ \fB\-Z\fP ] [ \fB\-:\fP ] 
[ \fB\-bi\fP[\fBs\fP][\fIn\fP] ] [ \fB\-bo\fP[\fBs\fP] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsplitxyz\fP reads a series of (x,y[,z]) records [or optionally (x,y,z,d,h); see \fB\-S\fP 
option] from standard input [or \fIxyz[dh]file\fP] and splits this into separate lists 
of (x,y[,z]) series, such that each series has a nearly constant azimuth through the x,y plane.  
There are options to choose only those series which have a certain orientation, to set a 
minimum length for series, and to high\- or low\-pass filter the z values and/or the x,y 
values.  \fBsplitxyz\fP is a useful filter between data extraction and \fBpswiggle\fP plotting, 
and can also be used to divide a large x,y,z dataset into segments.  The output is always
in the ASCII format; input may be ASCII or binary (see \fB\-b\fP).
.TP
\fIxyz[dh]file(s)\fP
3 (but see \fB\-Z\fP) [or 5] column ASCII file [or binary, see \fB\-b\fP] holding (x,y,z[,d,h]) data values.  To use (x,y,z,d,h) input, 
sorted so that d is non-decreasing, specify the \fB\-S\fP option; default expects (x,y,z) only.  
If no file is specified, \fBsplitxyz\fP will read from standard input.
.TP
.B \-C
Terminate a segment when a course change exceeding \fIcourse_change\fP degrees of heading 
is detected.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Write out only those segments which are within +/- \fItolerance\fP degrees of \fIazimuth\fP 
in heading, measured clockwise from North, [0 - 360].  [Default writes all acceptable 
segments, regardless of orientation].
.TP
.B \-D
Do not write a segment out unless it is at least \fIminimum_distance\fP units long.  
[Default = 100 distance units].
.TP
.B \-F
Filter the z values and/or the x,y values, assuming these are functions of d coordinate.  
\fIxy_filter\fP and  \fIz_filter\fP are filter widths in distance units.  If a filter width 
is zero, the filtering is not performed.  The absolute value of the width is the 
full width of a cosine\-arch low\-pass filter.  If the width is positive, the data are 
low\-pass filtered; if negative, the data are high\-pass filtered by subtracting the 
low\-pass value from the observed value.  If \fIz_filter\fP is non\-zero, 
the entire series of input z values is filtered before any segmentation is performed, so 
that the only edge effects in the filtering will happen at the beginning and end of the 
complete data stream.  If \fIxy_filter\fP is non\-zero, the data is first divided into 
segments and then the x,y values of each segment are filtered separately.  This may introduce 
edge effects at the ends of each segment, but prevents a low\-pass x,y filter from rounding 
off the corners of track segments.  [Default = no filtering].
.TP
.B \-G
Do not let a segment  have a gap exceeding \fIgap_distance\fP; instead, split it into two 
segments.  [Default = 10 distance units].
#include "explain_-H.txt"
Not used with binary data.
.TP
.B \-M
Use Map units.  Then x,y are in degrees of longitude, latitude, and distances 
in kilometers.  [Default:  distances are cartesian in same units as x,y].
.TP
.B \-N
Create Named output files, writing each segment to a separate file in the working directory 
named \fInamestem\fP.profile\fI#\fP, where \fI#\fP increases consecutively from 1.  [Default 
writes entire output to stdout, separating segments by sub-headings that start with > marks].
.TP
.B \-S
d and h is supplied.  In this case, input contains x,y,z,d,h.
[Default expects (x,y,z) input, and d,h are computed from delta x, 
delta y, according to \fB\-M\fP option]
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-Z
Data have x,y only (no z-column).
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-i.txt"
#include "explain_-n.txt"
[Default is 2, 3, or 5 input columns as set by \fB\-S, \-Z\fP].

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Suppose you want to make a wiggle plot of magnetic anomalies on segments oriented 
approximately east\-west from a cruise called cag71 in the region \-R300/315/12/20.  
You want to use a 100km low\-pass filter to smooth the tracks and a 500km high\-pass 
filter to detrend the magnetic anomalies.  Try this:
.br

MGD-77 users: For this application we recommend that you extract d, h from \fBgmtlist\fP rather than
have \fBsplitxyz\fP compute them separately.

Suppose you have been given a binary, double-precision file containing lat, lon, gravity values from a survey, 
and you want to split it into profiles named \fIsurvey\fP.profile\fI#\fP (when gap exceeds 100 km).  Try this:
.sp
splitxyz survey.bin \fB\-N\fPsurvey \fB\-V \-G\fP100 \fB\-: \-M \-bi\fP3
