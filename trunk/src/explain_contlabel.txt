Controls the placement of labels along the LINETYPEs.  Choose among four controlling algorithms:
.br
\fB\-G\fP\fBd\fP\fIdist\fP[c|i|m|p][/\fIwidth\fP] or \fB\-G\fP\fBD\fP\fIdist\fP[d|e|k|m|n][/\fIwidth\fP].
For lower case \fBd\fP, give distances between labels on the plot in your preferred measurement unit
\fBc\fP (cm), \fBi\fP (inch), \fBm\fP (meter), or \fBp\fP (points), while for upper case \fBD\fP, specify
distances in map units and append the unit; choose among \fBe\fP (m), \fBk\fP (km), \fBm\fP (mile), \fBn\fP
(nautical mile), or \fBd\fP (spherical degree).
In either case, optionally append number of (x,y) values used to calculate a smooth label angle [Default is
G_OPT_SI or G_OPT_US].  
.br
\fB\-Gl|L\fP\fIline1\fP[,\fIline2\fP,...] Give \fIstart\fP and \fIstop\fP coordinates for one or
more comma-separated straight line segments.  Labels will be placed where these lines intersect the
LINETYPEs.  The format of each \fIline\fP specification is \fIstart/stop\fP, where \fIstart\fP and \fIstop\fP
are either a specified point \fIlon/lat\fP or a 2-character \fBXY\fP key that uses the justification
format employed in \fBpstext\fP to indicate a point on the map, given as [LCR][BMT].
#ifdef GRID
In addition, you may use Z+ and Z- which correspond to the locations of the global max and min locations in
the grid, respectively.
#endif
\fB\-GL\fP will interpret the point pairs as defining great circles [Default is straight line].
.br
\fB\-Gn\fP\fIn_cont\fP specifies the number of equidistant labels per LINETYPE line [1].
Upper case \fB\-GN\fP starts labeling exactly at the start of the line [Default centers them along the line].
\fB\-GN\fP-1 places one justified label at start, while \fB\-GN\fP+1 places one justified label at the end of the LINETYPE.
.br
\fB\-Gx|X\fP\fIxfile.d\fP reads the multi-segment file \fIxfile.d\fP and places labels at the intersections
between the LINETYPEs and the lines in\fIxfile.d\fP.  \fB\-GX\fP will resample the lines first along
great-circle arcs.
