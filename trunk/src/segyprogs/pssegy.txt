.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(pssegy) reads a native (IEEE) format SEGY file and produces a
IT(PostScript) image of the seismic data. The IT(imagemask)
operator is used so that the seismic data are plotted as a 1-bit
deep bitmap in a single
(user-specified) color or gray shade, with a transparent background.
The bitmap resolution is taken from the current BD(GMT) defaults.
The seismic traces may be plotted at their true locations using information
in the trace headers (in which case order of the
traces in the file is not significant).
Standard BD(GMT) geometry routines are used so that
in principle any map projection may be used, however it is likely that the
geographic projections will lead to unexpected results. Beware also
that some parameters have non-standard meanings.

Note that the order of operations before the seismic data are plotted is
deviation*[clip]([bias]+[normalize](sample value)). Deviation determines
how far IT(in the plot coordinates) a [normalized][biased][clipped] sample
value of 1 plots from the trace location.

The SEGY file should be a disk image of the tape format (ie 3200 byte
text header, which is ignored, 400 byte binary reel header, and
240 byte header for each trace) with samples as native real*4 (IEEE real
on all the platforms to which I have access)
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(SEGYfile)
Seismic data set to be imaged
#include "explain_-J.txt"
#include "explain_-Rgeo.txt"
.br
.TP
OPT(D)IT(deviation)
gives the deviation in X units of the plot for 1.0 on the scaled trace.
.br 
.TP
OPT(F)[IT(rgb)|IT(gray)]
Fill trace (variable area, defaults to filling positive). rgb or gray gives
the color with which the imagemask is filled.
.TP
OPT(W)
Draw wiggle trace.
.TP
You IT(must) specify at least one of OPT(W) and OPT(F).
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(B)IT(bias)
Bias to apply to data (added to sample values).
.TP
OPT(C)IT(clip)
Sample value at which to clip data (clipping is applied to both positive and
negative values).
.TP
OPT(E)IT(error)
Allow IT(error) difference between requested and actual trace locations
when using BD(-T) option.
.TP
OPT(I)
Fill negative rather than positive excursions.
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
OPT(L)
Override number of samples per trace in reel header (program attempts to
determine number of samples from each trace header if possible to
allow for variable length traces).
.TP
OPT(M)
Override number of traces specified in reel header. Program detects
end of file (relatively) gracefully, but this parameter limits number
of traces that the program attempts to read.
.TP
OPT(N)
Normalize trace by dividing by rms amplitude over full trace length.
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
OPT(S)IT(header)
Read trace locations from trace headers: header is either c for CDP,
o for offset, or b<num> to read a long starting at byte <num> in the
header (first byte corresponds to num=0). Default has location given by
trace number.
.TP
OPT(T)IT(filename)
Plot only traces whose location corresponds to a list given in IT(filename).
Order in which traces are listed is not significant - the entire space is
checked for each trace.
.TP
OPT(U)IT(redvel)
Apply reduction velocity by shifting traces IT(upwards) by redvel/|offset|.
Negative velocity removes existing reduction. Units should be consistent with
offset in trace header and sample interval.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(X)IT(scale)
Multiply trace locations by scale before plotting.
.TP
OPT(Y)IT(sample_int)
Override sample interval in reel header.
.TP
OPT(Z)
Do not plot traces with zero rms amplitude.
