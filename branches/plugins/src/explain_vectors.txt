.SH VECTOR ATTRIBUTES
Several modifiers may be appended to the vector-producing options
to specify the placement of vector heads, their shapes, and the justification of the vector:
.br
.sp
MOD(a)IT(angle) sets the angle of the vector head apex [30].
.sp
MOD(b) places a vector head at the beginning of the vector path [none].
.sp
MOD(e) places a vector head at the end of the vector path [none].
.sp
MOD(g)-|IT(fill) turns off vector head fill (if -) or sets the vector head fill
[Default fill is used, which may be no fill].
.sp
MOD(l) draws half-arrows, using only the left side [both].
.sp
MOD(n)IT(norm) scales down vector attributes (pen thickness, head size) with decreasing length,
where vectors shorter than IT(norm) will have their
attributes scaled by length/IT(norm) [arrow attributes remains invariant to length].
.sp
MOD(p)[-][IT(pen)] sets the vector pen attributes.  If IT(pen) has a leading - then
the head outline is not drawn. [Default pen is used, and head outline is drawn]
.sp
MOD(r) draws half-arrows, using only the right side [both].
.sp
In addition, all but circular vectors may take these modifiers:
.sp
MOD(j)IT(just) determines how the input IT(x),IT(y) point relates
to the vector.  Choose from BD(b)eginning [default], BD(e)nd, or BD(c)enter.
.sp
MOD(s) means the input IT(angle), IT(length) is instead the IT(x), IT(y) coordinates
of the vector end point.
