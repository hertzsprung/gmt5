.SH NAME
gshhs \- Extract data tables from binary GSHHS or WDBII data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(gshhs) IT(binaryfile.b) [ OPT(A)IT(min) ] [ OPT(G) ] [ OPT(I)IT(id) ] [ OPT(L) ] \
[ GMT_bo_OPT ] [ GMT_o_OPT ] > IT(asciifile.txt)
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(gshhs) reads the binary coastline (GSHHS) or political boundary or river (WDBII) files and
extracts an ASCII listing.  It automatically handles byte-swabbing between different
architectures.  Optionally, only segment header info can be displayed.  The header info has
the format IT(ID npoints  hierarchical-level source area f_area west east south north container ancestor),
where hierarchical levels for coastline polygons go from 1 (shoreline) to 4 (lake inside
island inside lake inside land).  Source is either W (World Vector Shoreline) or C (CIA World
Data Bank II); lower case is used if a lake is a river-lake. The IT(west east south north) is
the enclosing rectangle, area is the polygon area in km^2 while f_area is the actual area of the
ancestor polygon, container is the ID of the polygon that contains this polygon (-1 if none),
and ancestor is the ID of the polygon in the full resolution set that was reduced to yield this
polygon (-1 if full resolution).
For line data the header is simply
IT(ID npoints  hierarchical-level source west east south north)

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(binaryfile.b)
GSHHS or WDBII binary data file as distributed with the GSHHS data supplement.  Any of the
5 standard resolutions (full, high, intermediate, low, crude) can be used.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(A)IT(min)
Only output information for the polygon if its area equals or exceeds IT(min) [default outputs all polygons].
.TP
OPT(G)
Write output that can be imported into GNU Octave or Matlab by ending segments with a NaN-record.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(id)
Only output information for the polygon that matches IT(id) [default outputs all polygons].
.TP
OPT(L)
Only output a listing of polygon or line segment headers [default outputs headers and data records].

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To convert the entire intermediate GSHHS binary data to ASCII, run
.sp
BD(gshhs) gshhs_i.b > gshhs_i.txt
.sp
To only get a listing of the headers for the river data set at full resolution, try
.sp
BD(gshhs) wdb_rivers_f.b OPT(L) > riverlisting.txt
.SH BUGS
While the GSHHS data is organized as a set of closed polygons, the rivers and boundary
data are just a set of line segments in no particular order.  Thus, it is not possible
to extract information pertaining to just one river or one country.
