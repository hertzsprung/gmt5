OPT(B)
Sets map boundary annotation and tickmark intervals. The format of \fItickinfo\fP is
[\fBp\fP|\fBs\fP]\fIxinfo\fP[/\fIyinfo\fP[/\fIzinfo\fP]][\fB:.\fP"Title"\fB:\fP][\fBW\fP|\fBw\fP][\fBE\fP|\fBe\fP][\fBS\fP|\fBs\fP][\fBN\fP|\fBn\fP][\fBZ\fP|\fBz\fP[\fB+\fP]].
The leading \fBp\fP [Default] or \fBs\fP selects the primary or secondary annotation information.
Each of the \fI?info\fP segments are textstrings of the form
\fIinfo\fP[\fB:\fP"Axis label"\fB:\fP][\fB:=\fP"prefix"\fB:\fP][\fB:,\fP"unit label"\fB:\fP].
The \fIinfo\fP string is made up of one or more concatenated substrings of the form [\fBwhich\fP]\fIstride\fP[+-\fIphase\fP][\fBu\fP].
The optional \fBwhich\fP can be either \fBa\fP for annotation tick spacing [Default], \fBf\fP for frame tick spacing, and
\fBg\fP for gridline spacing.  If frame interval is not set, it is assumed to be the same
as annotation interval. \fIstride\fP is the desired stride interval.  The optional \fIphase\fP shifts the annotation
interval by that amount.  The optional \fBu\fP indicates the unit of the \fIstride\fP and can be any of
\fBY\fP (year, plot with 4 digits), \fBy\fP (year, plot with 2 digits), \fBO\fP (month, plot using \fBPLOT_DATE_FORMAT\fP),
\fBo\fP (month, plot with 2 digits), \fBU\fP (ISO week, plot using \fBPLOT_DATE_FORMAT\fP), \fBu\fP (ISO week, plot using 2 digits),
\fBr\fP (Gregorian week, 7-day stride from start of week \fBTIME_WEEK_START\fP), \fBK\fP (ISO weekday, plot name of day),
\fBD\fP (date, plot using \fBPLOT_DATE_FORMAT\fP), \fBd\fP (day, plot day of month 0-31 or year 1-366, via \fBPLOT_DATE_FORMAT\fP),
\fBR\fP (day, same as \fBd\fP, aligned with \fBTIME_WEEK_START\fP), \fBH\fP (hour, plot using \fBPLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT\fP),
\fBh\fP (hour, plot with 2 digits), \fBM\fP (minute, plot using \fBPLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT\fP), \fBm\fP (minute, plot with 2 digits), 
\fBC\fP (second, plot using \fBPLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT\fP), \fBc\fP (second, plot with 2 digits).  Note for geographic axes
\fBm\fP and \fBc\fP instead mean arc minutes and arc seconds.  All entities that are language-specific are under control
by \fBTIME_LANGUAGE\fP.  To specify separate x and y ticks, separate the substrings that apply to the x and y
axes with a slash [/] (If a 3-D basemap is selected with OPT(E) and OPT(Jz), a third substring pertaining
to the vertical axis may be appended.)  For linear/log/power projections (OPT(Jx)|\fBX\fP): Labels
for each axis can be added by surrounding them with colons (\fB:\fP).  If the first character in the
label is a period, then the label is used as plot title; if it is a comma (\fB,\fP) then the label is
appended to each annotation; if it is an equal sign (\fB=\fP) the the prefix is prepended to each annotation (start label/prefix
with - to avoid space between annotation and item); else it is the axis label.
If the label consists of more than one word, enclose the entire label in double quotes (e.g.,
\fB:\fP"my label"\fB:\fP).
If you need to use a colon (:) as part of your label you must specify it using its octal code (\\072).
.br
By default, all 4 boundaries are plotted (referred to as \fBW, E, S, N\fP).  To change the default,
append the code for only those axes you want (e.g., \fBWS\fP for standard lower-left x- and y-axis system).
Upper case (e.g., \fBW\fP) means draw axis/tickmarks AND annotate it, whereas lower case
(e.g., \fBw\fP) will only draw axis/tickmarks.  (If a 3-D basemap is selected with OPT(E) and
OPT(Jz), append \fBZ\fP or \fBz\fP to control the appearance
of the vertical axis.  Append \fB+\fP to draw the outline of the cube defined by OPT(R).  Note
that for 3-D views the title, if given, will be suppressed.)
.br
For non-geographical projections:
Give negative scale (in OPT(Jx)) or axis length (in OPT(JX)) to change the direction
of increasing coordinates (i.e., to make the y-axis positive down).  For log10 axes:  Annotations
can be specified in one of three ways:  (1) \fIstride\fP can be 1, 2, 3, or -\fIn\fP.  Annotations will then
occur at 1, 1\-2\-5, or 1\-2\-3\-4\-...\-9, respectively; for -\fIn\fP we annotate every \fIn\fP't magnitude.
This option can also be used for
the frame and grid intervals.  (2) An \fBl\fP is appended to the \fItickinfo\fP string.
Then, log10 of the tick value is plotted at every integer log10 value.  (3) A \fBp\fP is appended
to the \fItickinfo\fP string.  Then, annotations appear as 10 raised to log10 of the tick value.
For power axes: Annotations can be specified in one of two ways:  (1) \fIstride\fP sets the
regular annotation interval.  (2) A \fBp\fP is appended to the \fItickinfo\fP string.  Then,
the annotation interval is expected to be in transformed units, but the annotation value
will be plotted as untransformed units.  E.g., if \fIstride\fP = 1 and \fIpower\fP = 0.5 (i.e., sqrt),
then equidistant annotations labeled 1\-4\-9... will appear.
