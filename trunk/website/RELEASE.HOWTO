#		FOR 4.x SERIES

PRE-RELEASE TASKS:

1.  Decide on a future date at which point GMT is to be released.
    Be prepared to change the date if the  bug-fixing workload is
    too great.  Send email to gmt-team@hawaii.edu and tell
    them the date and ask for updates.
    
RELEASE TASKS:

When you are ready to officially release a new GMT version you
must ensure you do all the steps listed below:

0.  Make any changes to README, README.WIN32, and Changelog.
    Finalize Announcements/Announce.4.*.  Make sure the macros
    in the gmtsite.macros file points to the actual FTP and WWW dirs.
    Check version number and release data in configure.ac

1.  run make latest-config
    get the latest config.sub and config.guess.  Make sure this worked
    since sometimes we get blank files...
    cd website
    
2.  Run cvs commit from the main GMT directory to check in any
    uncommitted changes.

3.  Compile and make all to make sure it all works (check examples)
    make site
   
4.  Tag the release(s), e.g.
    cvs -q tag Release_2007_10_08_GMT_4_2_1

5.  Prepare the archives:
    make archive >& log
   
6.  Determine file sizes of all archives and update these values
    in guru/install_gmt and website/gmt_install_form.html
   
7.  Run GMT_winbuild.bat under Parallels which will build
    the three Windows installers and place them in GMT/ftp.

8.  In GMT/ftp, update .message, README.GMT, and VERSION

9.  In GMT/website:
    a) Update gmt_arrrghh.html, gmt_bugs.html, gmt_faq.html,
       gmt_install_form.html, gmt_news.html, gmt_releases.html
    b) create web examples:
