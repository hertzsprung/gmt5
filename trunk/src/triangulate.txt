.SH NAME
triangulate \- Perform optimal Delaunay triangulation and gridding of Cartesian data [method]
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(triangulate) IT(infiles) [ OPT(Dx)|BD(y) ] [ OPT(E)IT(empty) ] 
[ OPT(G)IT(grdfile) ] [ GMT_I_OPT ] [ GMT_J_OPT ] [ OPT(M) ] [ OPT(Q) ] [ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ] [ OPT(Z) ] [ GMT_b_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ] [ GMT_h_OPT ] [ GMT_i_OPT ] [ GMT_r_OPT ] [ GMT_colon_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(triangulate) reads one or more ASCII [or binary] files (or standard input) containing x,y[,z] and
performs Delaunay triangulation, i.e., it find how the points should be connected to give
the most equilateral triangulation possible.  If a map projection (give OPT(R) and OPT(J)) is chosen then it is applied before
the triangulation is calculated.  By default, the output is triplets of point id numbers
that make up each triangle and is written to standard output.
The id numbers refer to the points position (line number, starting at 0 for the first line) in the input file.
As an option, you may choose to create a multiple segment file that can be piped through
BD(psxy) to draw the triangulation network.  If OPT(G) OPT(I) are set a grid will be calculated based
on the surface defined by the planar triangles.  The actual algorithm used
in the triangulations is either that of Watson [1982] [Default] or Shewchuk [1996] (if installed; type
BD(triangulate \-) to see which method is selected).
This choice is made during the BD(GMT) installation.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(infiles)
Data files with the point coordinates in ASCII (or binary; see GMT_bi_OPT).  If no files are given the standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(Dx)|BD(y)
Take either the IT(x)- or IT(y)-derivatives of surface represented
by the planar facets (only used when OPT(G) is set).
.TP
OPT(E)IT(empty)
Set the value assigned to empty nodes when OPT(G) is set [NaN].
.TP
OPT(G)IT(grdfile)
Use triangulation to grid the data onto an even grid (specified with OPT(R) OPT(I)).  Append
the name of the output grid file.  The interpolation is performed in the
original coordinates, so if your triangles are close to the poles you are
better off projecting all data to a local coordinate system before using
BD(triangulate) (this is true of all gridding routines).
.TP
OPT(I)
IT(x_inc) [and optionally IT(y_inc)] sets the grid  size for optional grid output (see OPT(G)).
Append BD(m) to indicate arc minutes or BD(s) to indicate arc seconds.
#include "explain_-J.txt"
.TP
OPT(M)
Output triangulation network as multiple line segments separated by a segment header record.
.TP
OPT(Q)
Output the edges of the Voronoi cells instead [Default is Delaunay triangle edges].  Requires
OPT(R) and is only available if linked with the Shewchuk [1996] library.
#include "explain_-R.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(Z)
Controls whether binary data file has two or three columns [2].  Ignored if GMT_bi_OPT
is not set.
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 2 input columns].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default is same as input].
Node ids are stored as double triplets.

Only valid with OPT(G)).

.SH EXAMPLES
To triangulate the points in the file samples.xyz, store the triangle information in a binary file, and
make a grid for the given area and spacing, use
.br
.sp
triangulate samples.xyz -bo -R0/30/0/30 -I2 -Gsurf.nc > samples.ijk
.br
.sp
To draw the optimal Delaunay triangulation network based on the same file using a
LEN-cm-wide Mercator map, use
.br
.sp
triangulate samples.xyz -M -R-100/-90/30/34 SCALE | psxy -R-100/-90/30/34 SCALE
-W0.5p -B1 > network.ps
.br
.sp
To instead plot the Voronoi cell outlines, try
.br
triangulate samples.xyz -M -Q -R-100/-90/30/34 SCALE | psxy -R-100/-90/30/34 SCALE
-W0.5p -B1 > cells.ps
