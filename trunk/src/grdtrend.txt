.SH NAME
grdtrend \- Fit and/or remove a polynomial trend in a grd file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrdtrend\fP \fIgrdfile\fP \fB\-N\fP\fIn_model\fP[\fBr\fP] 
[ \fB\-D\fP\fIdiff.grd\fP ] [ \fB\-T\fP\fItrend.grd\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ] 
[ \fB\-W\fP\fIweight.grd\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdtrend\fP reads a 2-D gridded file and fits a low-order polynomial
trend to these data by [optionally weighted] least-squares.  The trend surface is 
defined by:
.sp
m1 + m2*x + m3*y + m4*x*y + m5*x*x + m6*y*y + m7*x*x*x + m8*x*x*y + m9*x*y*y + m10*y*y*y.
.sp
The user must specify \fB\-N\fP\fIn_model\fP, the number of model parameters to use; 
thus, \fB\-N\fP\fI4\fP fits a bilinear trend, \fB\-N\fP\fI6\fP a quadratic surface, 
and so on.  Optionally, append \fBr\fP to the \fB\-N\fP option to perform a 
robust fit.  In this case, the program will iteratively reweight the data based on 
a robust scale estimate, in order to converge to a solution insensitive to outliers.  
This may be handy when separating a "regional" field from a "residual" which should 
have non-zero mean, such as a local mountain on a regional surface.
.sp
If data file has values set to NaN, these will be ignored during fitting; if output 
files are written, these will also have NaN in the same locations.
.sp
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
\fIgrdfile\fP
The name of a 2-D binary grd file.
.TP
.B \-N
\fIn_model\fP[\fBr\fP] sets the number of model parameters to fit.  Append \fBr\fP for robust fit.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-D
Write the difference (input data - trend) to the file \fIdiff.grd\fP.
.TP
.B \-T
Write the fitted trend to the file \fItrend.grd\fP.
.TP
.B \-V
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].
.TP
.B \-W
If \fIweight.grd\fP exists, it will be read and used to solve a weighted 
least-squares problem.  [Default:  Ordinary least-squares fit.]  If the robust 
option has been selected, the weights used in the robust fit will be written to 
\fIweight.grd\fP.
.SH REMARKS
The domain of x and y will be shifted and scaled to [-1, 1] and the basis functions are built from 
Legendre polynomials.  These have a numerical advantage in the form of the matrix which must be 
inverted and allow more accurate solutions.  NOTE: The model parameters listed with \fB\-V\fP are 
Legendre polynomial coefficients; they are not numerically equivalent to the m#s in the equation 
described above.  The description above is to allow the user to match \fB\-N\fP with the order of the 
polynomial surface.    
.SH EXAMPLES
