# This is README for the test directory
# Each program should have a separate directory
# which may contain any number of Bourne (*.sh)
# and csh (*.csh) scripts that tests one or more
# aspects of the program.
# The script should report a pass/fail grade so
# that it is easy to tell which test failed.
