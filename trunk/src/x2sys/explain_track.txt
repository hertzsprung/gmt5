\fItracks\fP
Can be one or more binary or ASCII data files. To use a file with a list of tracks,
specify the name of the track list after a colon
(e.g., :tracks.lis).  If the names are missing their file extension we will
append the suffix specified for this \fITAG\fP.  Track files will be looked
for first in the current directory and second in all directories listed in
\fB$X2SYS_HOME\fP/\fITAG\fP_paths.txt (if it exists). [If \fB$X2SYS_HOME\fP
is not set it will default to \fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/x2sys].
