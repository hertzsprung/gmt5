/*
 * gmt_proj.c contains the specific projection functions that convert
 * longitude and latitude to x, y.  These are used via function pointers
 * set in gmt_map.c
 *
 * Map_projections include functions that will set up the transformation
 * between xy and latlon for several map projections.
 *
 * A few of the core coordinate transformation functions are based on similar
 * FORTRAN routines written by Pat Manley, Doug Shearer, and Bill Haxby, and
 * have been rewritten in C and subsequently streamlined.  The Lambert conformal
 * was originally coded up by Bernie Coakley.  The rest is coded by Wessel/Smith
 * based on P. Snyder, "Map Projections - a working manual", USGS Prof paper 1395.
 *
 * Transformations supported (both forward and inverse):
 *
 * Non-geographic projections:
 *
 *	Linear x/y[/z] scaling
 *	Polar (theta, r) scaling
 *
 * Map projections:
 *
 *  Cylindrical:
 *	Mercator
 *	Cassini Cylindrical
 *	Braun Cylindrical (e.g., Gall, B.S.A.M)
 *	Miller Cylindrical
 *	Oblique Mercator
 *	TM Transverse Mercator (Ellipsoidal and Spherical)
 *	UTM Universal Transverse Mercator
 *	Cylindrical Equal-area (e.g., Gall-Peters, Behrmann)
 *	Cylindrical Equidistant (Plate Carree)
 *  Conic:
 *	Albers Equal-Area Conic
 *	Lambert Conformal Conic
 *	Equidistant Conic
 *  Azimuthal:
 *	Stereographic Conformal
 *	Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area
 *	Orthographic
 *	Azimuthal Equidistant
 *	Gnomonic
 *  Thematic:
 *	Mollweide Equal-Area
 *	Hammer-Aitoff Equal-Area
 *	Sinusoidal Equal-Area
 *	Winkel Tripel
 *	Robinson
