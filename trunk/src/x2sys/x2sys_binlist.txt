.TH X2SYS_BINLIST GMTMANSECTION DATE VERSION VERSION
.SH NAME
x2sys_binlist \- Create bin-index files from track data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP \fItrack(s)\fP [ \fB\-T\fP\fITAG\fP ] [ \fB\-Cc\fP|\fBf\fP|\fBg\fP|\fBe\fP ] 
[ \fB\-D\fP ] [ \fB\-N\fP\fIunit\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP reads one or more track data files and produces a multi-
segment ASCII track bin index listing with the cruise id in the header and
one data record per bin crossed; these record contain \fIlon, lat, index, flags\fP[, \fIdist\fP],
where \fIlon, lat\fP is the coordinates of the center of the bin, the \fIindex\fP is
the 1-D number of the bin, and \fIflags\fP is a bitflag that describes which data
fields were available in each bin.  The optional \fIdist\fP requires \fB\-D\fP.
The input files can be of any format, which must be described and passed with the
\fB\-T\fP option.  The bin index listing is a crude representation of where
the track goes and is used by the data archivist to determine which tracks
need to be compared for crossover analysis.  You must run \fBx2ys_init\fP
to initialize the tag before you can run the indexing.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-C
Append a one-letter code to select the procedure for along-track distance
calculation selected with \fB\-D\fP (see \fB\-N\fP for selecting units):
.br
	\fBc\fP Cartesian distances in user units [Default].
.br
	\fBf\fP Flat Earth distances.
.br
	\fBg\fP Great circle distances.
.br
	\fBe\fP Geodesic distances on current GMT ellipsoid.
.TP
.B \-D
Calculate the length of trackline segments per bin [Default skips this step].
See \fB\-C\fP for method and \fB\-N\fP for units.  The length fragments are
given as the 5th output column (after the \fIflags\fP).
.TP
.B \-N
Append the desired distance \fIunit\fP as \fBe\fP (meter), \fBk\fP (km),
\fBm\fP (miles), or \fBn\fP (nautical miles).  [Default is \fB\-Nk\fP (km)].
Requires \fB\-D\fP.
.TP
.B \-T
Sets the data set \fITAG\fP which among other things sets the definition file.

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a bin index table from the MGD77 file 01030061.mgd77 using a global, 1x1 degree bin system, do
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP 01030061.mgd77 \fB\-T\fPMGD77 > index.d
.br
.sp
To create a bin index list of all MGD77+ files residing in the current directory at a bin resolution
of 30x30 minutes, calculating the geodesic distance lengths for each bin in km, run
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP *.nc \fB\-T\fPMGD77+ \fB\-Ce \-D\fP > index.d
