\chapter{Preface} 
\thispagestyle{headings}

While \GMT\ has served the map-making and data processing needs of scientists since 1988\footnote{when
version 1.0 was released at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.}, the current global use was
heralded by the first official release in {\it EOS Trans. AGU} in the fall of 1991.  Since then,
\GMT\ has grown to become a standard tool for many Earth and Ocean scientists.  Development
has at times been rapid, and numerous releases have seen the light of day since the early versions.
For a history of the changes from release to release, see the online
\htmladdnormallink{Release Announcements}{http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/gmt_releases.html}
and the file \filename{CHANGES} in the main \GMT\ directory.

The success of \GMT\ is to a large degree due to the input of the user community. In fact, most of the
capabilities and options in \GMT\ programs were driven by user requests.
We would like to hear from you should you have any suggestions for future enhancements and modification.

\section{What is new in \gmt\ 4?}

\GMT\ 4 represents a major overhaul of the package; hence the major version increment.  There are three
categories of changes that has been implemented:
\begin{description}
\item [Time-series support].  \GMT\ can now read and write time-series data where
the time coordinates are of the form {\it date}{\bf T}{\it clock}.  The formats
used for \it date} and {\it clock} are under the user's control.  Both Gregorian
and ISO calendars are supported.  Frame annotation for time-series are now supported
via the \Opt{B} option which has many new modifiers to accomodate the vast number of
ways one may want to annotate time axes, including support for primary and secondary
annotation levels and the day- and month-names in numerous languages (if your language
is not supported, send us the info we need).  The capability to handle time (in \Opt{R},
\Opt{J}, \Opt{B}, i/o and plotting) represents considerable changes ``under the hood'',
including the introduction of numerous new \GMTprog{gmtdefaults} parameters to make
time series support as ``generic'' as we need it to be.
\item [New Tools].  Three new tools have been added:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \GMTprog{gmt2rgb}: Make red, green, and blue component gridfiles from an image (to be
used for false color images or draping).
\item \GMTprog{grdblend}: Blend several partially over-lapping grdfiles onto one combined grid.
\item \GMTprog{pslegend}: Plot elaborate legends on maps.
\end{enumerate}
\item [New Program Options].  Many programs have received additional options or
features that enhances their usefulness:
\begin{itemize}
\item \GMTprog{blockmean}:	New option \Opt{Sw} will return weight sum while \Opt{Sz} returns
the data sums (i.e., the same as \Opt{S}).
\item \GMTprog{filter1d}:	New filters \Opt{Fl$|$L$|$u$|$U} that return extreme values.
\item \GMTprog{gmtconvert}:	Added new options \Opt{F}, \Opt{A},  and \Opt{I} that simulate
\UNIX\ \progname{cut}, \progname{paste}, and \progname{tail} \Opt{r} (or \progname{tac}) capabilities.
Otion \Opt{E} reports first and last point per segment only, \Opt{L} lists the segment headers only,
while \Opt{S} lists records from segments whose header matches a given text pattern.
\item \GMTprog{gmtmath}:	Added new operators for solving least squares problems ({\bf COL, LSQFIT}),
finding function roots ({\bf ROOTS}), and evaluating critical values ({\bf CHICRIT, FCRIT, TCRIT, ZCRIT}).
We added some general functions ({\bf SINC, LOG2, LRAND}) and miscellaneous operations ({\bf FLIPUD, NEQ}).
The \Opt{S} option now takes a modifier to select first or last record only.
\item \GMTprog{gmtselect}:	New option  \Opt{Z} to pass or skip based of $z$-range.
\item \GMTprog{grd2cpt}:	New options  \Opt{Q} for logarithmic scales, \Opt{E} for equidistant color
intervals, \Opt{R} for selecting a grid sub-region, and \Opt{N} to suppress output of B, N, F colors.
\item \GMTprog{grd2xyz}:	New option \Opt{W} to write constant weight factor, and the ability to
process several grid files at the same time.
\item \GMTprog{grdcontour}:	Expanded the \Opt{G} option to handle 5 ways to place contour labels. 
\item \GMTprog{grdedit}:	New option \Opt{N} to replaces some node values given {\it x, y, z} data
in a table (options \Opt{H}, \Opt{b}, \Opt{f}, and \Opt{:} added for file support).
\item \GMTprog{grdfilter}:	New geospatial filters \Opt{Fl$|$L$|$u$|$U} that return extreme values. 
\item \GMTprog{grdimage}:	New option for colormasking (\Opt{Q}; \PS\ Level 3 only), \PS\ image 
interpolation (\Opt{E}{\it -dpi}), and false RGB color image (if given three grids).
\item \GMTprog{grdinfo}:	New option to create argument for \GMTprog{makecpt} (\Opt{T}) and to round-off
region (\Opt{I}). 
\item \GMTprog{grdmath}:	Added new operators for critical values ({\bf CHICRIT, FCRIT, TCRIT, ZCRIT}),
geospatial analysis ({\bf LDIST,  PDIST, INSIDE}), for calculating azimuths ({\bf CAS, SAZ}), some general
functions ({\bf SINC, LOG2, LRAND}) and miscellaneous grid operations ({\bf FLIPLR, FLIPUD, ROTX, ROTY, NEQ,
INRANGE}).  We may now create multiple output grids from a single command.
\item \GMTprog{grdreformat}: Option to suppress header in raw output (\Opt{N}).
\item \GMTprog{grdsample}:	Option to push the bilinear interpolation closer to nodes that are NaN (\Opt{Q}).
\item \GMTprog{grdtrack}:	Options to retrieve nearest node value (\Opt{N}, no interpolation) and to push
the bilinear interpolation closer to nodes that are NaN (\Opt{Q}).
\item \GMTprog{grdview}:	Colormasking (\Opt{Qc}, PS Level 3 only), draping of images via red, green,
and blue component grids (\Opt{G}).  Also,  drapegrids can have higher resolution that the relief grid.
\item \GMTprog{makecpt}:	New options \Opt{Q} for logarithmic scales and \Opt{N} to suppress output
of B, N, F colors.
\item \GMTprog{mapproject}:	New options for datum conversions (\Opt{T}, \Opt{E}, and \Opt{Q}), azimuth and
back-azimuth (\Opt{A}) and point distance (\Opt{G}) calculations, and distances to a line (\Opt{L}.
\item \GMTprog{minmax}:		Added \Opt{T}{\it dz} option to produce \Opt{T} string for \GMTprog{makecpt},
\Opt{E} for returning extreme records, and \Opt{I} was extended to handle any number of columns if \Opt{C} is used.
\item \GMTprog{psbasemap}:	Extended \Opt{L} to allow alternate label and justification and added \Opt{T}
for directional rose ornament or magnetic compass directions.
\item \GMTprog{pscoast}:	Extended \Opt{L} to allow alternate label and justification and added \Opt{T}
for directional rose ornament or magnetic compass directions.
\item \GMTprog{pscontour}:	Expanded the \Opt{G} option to handle 5 ways to place contour labels. 
\item \GMTprog{psimage}:	\PS\ image interpolation (\Opt{W}{\it -xlength}), and justification option
in \Opt{C}.
\item \GMTprog{psscale}:	Options to annotate on opposite side (\Opt{A}) and \Opt{E}[{\bf b$|$f}] to set
back or foreground triangle only.  Also, draw discrete table with centered annotations by appending an optional
{\it gap} to the \Opt{L} option. 
\item \GMTprog{pstext}: 	Option \Opt{A} if azimuths rather than angles are given
\item \GMTprog{psxy}: 	Line color control via \Opt{C}, offset symbols (with \Opt{D}), access custom symbols
(\Opt{Sk}; use 30 that come with \GMT\ or design your own), many new symbols (horizontal and vertical dashes,
pentagon, octagon, rectangle, double-header and centered vectors), and annotated (``quoted'') lines with \Opt{Sq}.
\item \GMTprog{psxyz}: 	Same, plus vertical dash symbol.
\item \GMTprog{xyz2grd}: 	Added \Opt{Au$|$l} for upper/lower value at each node.
\end{itemize}
\item [General enhancements].  These affect most or all programs under the hood:
\begin{itemize}
\item New shorthand for the most recent projection (\Opt{J}).
\item Options for phase-shifting the stride and supply prefix for annotations (\Opt{B}).
\item Override \GMT\ defaults directly on the command line with {--}{--}\emph{PAR=value} options.
\item Choose from 50 ellipsoids and 207 datums, plus add custom values.
\item Numerous new \GMT\ defaults parameters, mostly in support of time-series functionality.
\item Shorthand for global regions (\Opt{Rg$|$d}).
\item Full support for either RGB, HSV, or CMYK in pen/fill options or in cpt files.
\item Support for color names.
\item Choice of unit when specifying pen thickness (cm, inch, point)
\item Easier pen specification mechanism, with predefined names for certain pen thicknesses.
\item Centering plots on current page with \Opt{Xc}, \Opt{Yc}.
\item More control on in/output formats (\Opt{f}, \Opt{:}[{\bf i$|$o}]).
\item Ability to read and write NOAA/NGDC GRD98 grid format.
\item Ability to add additional fonts.
\item Custom paper media size (useful for posters and large maps).
\item All text is now justified by the \PS\ interpreter itself.
\item Better support for various international character encodings.
\item New Appendix M (color tables), N (custom symbols), and O (contours and ``quoted lines'').
\item Use \filename{.gmtdefaults4} and \filename{.gmtcommands4} to ensure peaceful coexistance with \GMT\ 3-series.
\item Data files in directories pointed to by environmental parameters {\bf \$GMT_DATADIR}, {\bf \$GMT_GRIDDIR},
and {\bf \$GMT_IMGDIR} can be specified without full path.
\item We have added five new examples.
\item Utility \progname{gmtswitch} simplifies switching between installed \GMT\ versions.
\end{itemize}
