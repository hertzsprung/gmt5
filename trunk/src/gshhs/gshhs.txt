.SH NAME
gshhs \- Extract ASCII listings from binary GSHHS or WDBII data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgshhs\fP \fIbinaryfile.b\fP [ OPT(L) ] > \fIasciifile.txt\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgshhs\fP reads the binary coastline (GSHHS) or political boundary or river (WDBII) files and
extracts an ASCII listing.  It automatically handles byte-swabbing between different
architectures.  Optionally, only segment header info can be displayed
.TP
\fIbinaryfile.b\fP
GSHHS or WDBII binary data file as distributed with the GSHHS data supplement.  Any of the
5 standard resolutions (full, high, intermediate, low, crude) can be used.
.TP
.B \-L
Only outlut a listing of polygon or line segment headers [default outputs headers and data records].
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To convert the entire intermediate GSHHS binary data to ASCII, run
.sp
\fBgshhs\fP gshhs_i.b > gshhs_i.txt
.sp
To only get a listing of the headers for the river data set at full resolution, try
.sp
\fBgshhs\fP wdb_rivers_f.b OPT(L) > riverlisting.txt
.SH BUGS
While the GSHHS data is organized as a set of closed polygons, the rivers and boundary
data are just a set of line segments in no particular order.  Thus, it is not possible
to extract information pertaining to just one river or one country.
