   GMT 4 programs contain all the high-level functionality.


Prior to version 5, the bulk of *GMT* functionality was coded directly
in the standard *GMT* C program modules (e.g., ``surface.c``, ``psxy.c``, ``grdimage.c``, etc.). The
*GMT* library only offered access to low-level functions from which
those high-level *GMT* programs were built. The standard *GMT* programs
have been very successful, with tens of thousands of users world-wide.
However, the design of the main programs prevented developers from
leveraging *GMT* functionality from within other programming
environments since access to *GMT* tools could only be achieved via
system calls [1]_. Consequently, all data i/o had to be done via
temporary files. The design also prevented the *GMT* developers
themselves from taking advantage of these modules directly. For
instance, the tool :doc:`pslegend` needed to
make extensive use of system calls to :doc:`psxy` and
:doc:`pstext` in order to plot the lines,
symbols and text that make up a map legend, making it a very awkward
program to maintain.

   GMT 5 programs contain all the high-level functionality.


Starting with *GMT* version 5, all standard *GMT* programs have been
split into a short driver program (the “new” *GMT*  programs) and a
function “module”. The drivers simply call the corresponding
*GMT* modules; it is these modules that do all the work. These new
functions have been placed in a new *GMT* high-level API library and can
be called from a variety of environments (C/C++, Fortran, Python,
Matlab, Visual Basic, Julia, R, etc.) [2]_. For example, the main
program ``blockmean.c`` has been reconfigured as a high-level function
``GMT_blockmean()``, which does the actual spatial averaging and can
pass the result back to the calling program (or write it to file). The
previous behavior of ``blockmean.c`` is replicated by a short driver program that simply
collects user arguments and then calls ``GMT_blockmean()``. Indeed, the
driver programs for all the standard *GMT* programs are identical so
that the makefile generates them on-the-fly when it compiles and links
them with the *GMT* library into executables. Thus, ``blockmean.c`` and others do in
fact no longer exist.

The i/o abstraction layer
-------------------------

In order for this interface to be as flexible as possible we have
generalized the notion of input and output. Data that already reside in
an application's memory may serve as input to a *GMT* function. Other
sources of input may be file pointers and file descriptors (as well as
the already-supported mechanism for passing file names). For standard
data table i/o, the *GMT* API takes care of the task of assembling any
combination of files, pointers, and memory locations into *a single
virtual data set* from which the *GMT* function may read (a) all
records at once into memory, or (b) read one record at a time. Likewise,
*GMT* functions may write their output to a virtual destination, which
might be a memory location in the user’s application, a file pointer or
descriptor, or an output file. The *GMT* functions are unaware of these
details and simply read from a “source” and write to a “destination”.

Our audience
------------

Here, we document the new functions in the *GMT* API library for
application developers who wish to call these functions from their own
custom programs. At this point, only the new high-level *GMT* API is
fully documented and intended for public use. The structure and
documentation of the under-lying lower-level *GMT* library is not
finalized. Developers using these functions may risk disruption to their
programs due to changes we may make in the library in support of the
*GMT* API. However, developers who wish to make supplemental packages to
be distributed as part of *GMT* will (other than talk to us) probably
want to access the entire low-level *GMT* library as well. It is
unlikely that the low-level library will ever be fully documented.

Definitions
-----------

For the purpose of this documentation a few definitions are needed:

#. "Standard *GMT* program" refers to one of the traditional stand-alone
   command-line executables known to all *GMT* users, e.g.,
   :doc:`blockmean`, :doc:`psxy`,
   :doc:`grdimage`, etc. Prior to version 5,
   these were the only *GMT* executables available.

#. "\ *GMT* module" refers to the function in the *GMT* API library that
   is responsible for all the action taken by the corresponding
   *GMT* program. All such modules are given the same name as the
   corresponding program but carry the prefix ``GMT_``, e.g.,
   ``GMT_blockmean``.

#. "\ *GMT* application" refers to a new application written by any
   developer and may call one or more *GMT* functions to create a new
   *GMT*-compatible executable.

#. In the API description that follows we will use the type ``int`` to
   mean a 4-byte integer. All integers used in the API are 4-byte
   integers with the exception of one function where a longer integer is
   used. Since different operating systems have their own way of
   defining 8-byte integers we use C99’s ``int64_t`` for this purpose;
   it is guaranteed to yield the correct type that the *GMT* function
   expect.

In version 5, the standard *GMT* programs are themselves specific but
overly simple examples of *GMT* applications that only call the single
*GMT* function they are associated with. However, some programs such as
:doc:`pslegend`, :doc:`gmtconvert`,
:doc:`grdblend`,
:doc:`grdfilter` and others call several modules.

Recognized resources
--------------------

The *GMT* API knows how to read and write five types of data common to
*GMT* operations: CPT palette tables, data tables (ASCII or binary),
text tables, *GMT* grids and images (reading only). In addition, we
present two data types to facilitate the passing of simple user arrays
(one or more equal-length data columns of any data type, e.g., double,
char) and 2-D or 3-D user matrices (of any data type and column/row
organization [3]_). We refer to these data types as *GMT* *resources*.
There are many attributes for each of these resources and therefore we
use a top-level structure for each type to keep them all in one
container. These containers are given or returned by the *GMT* API
functions using opaque pointers (``void *``). Below we discuss these
containers in some detail; we will later present how they are used when
importing or exporting them to or from files, memory locations, or
streams. The first five are the standard *GMT* objects, while the latter
two are the special user data containers to facilitate converting user
data into *GMT* resources. These resources are defined in the include
file ``gmt_resources.h``; please consult this file to ensure correctness as it is difficult
to keep the documentation up-to-date.

Data tables
~~~~~~~~~~~

Much data processed in *GMT* come in the form of ASCII, netCDF, or
native binary data tables. These may have any number of header records
(ASCII files only) and perhaps segment headers. *GMT* programs will read
one or more such tables when importing data. However, to avoid memory
duplication or limitations some programs may prefer to read records one
at the time. The *GMT* API has functions that let you read
record-by-record by presenting a virtual data set that combines all the
data tables specified as input. This simplifies record processing
considerably. A ``struct GMT_DATASET`` may contain any number of tables,
each with any number of segments, each segment with any number of
records, and each record with any number of columns. Thus, the arguments
to *GMT* API functions that handle such data sets expect this type of
variable. All segments are expected to have the same number of columns.

Text tables
~~~~~~~~~~~

Some data needed by *GMT* are simply free-form ASCII text tables. These
are handled similarly to data tables. E.g., they may have any number of
header records and even segment headers, and *GMT* programs can read one
or more tables or get text records one at the time. A
``struct GMT_TEXTSET`` may contain any number of tables, each with any
number of segments, and each segment with any number of records. Thus,
the arguments to *GMT* API functions that handle such data sets expect
this type of variable. The user's program may then parse and process
such text records as required. This resources is particularly useful
when your data consist of a mix or data coordinates and ordinary text
since regular data tables will be parsed for floating-point columns
only.

GMT grids
~~~~~~~~~

*GMT* grids are used to represent equidistant and organized 2-D
surfaces. These can be plotted as contour maps, color images, or as
perspective surfaces. Because the native *GMT* grid is simply a 1-D
float array with all the metadata kept in a separate header, we pass
this information via a ``struct GMT_GRID``, which is a container that
holds both items. Thus, the arguments to *GMT* API functions that handle
such *GMT* grids expect this type of variable.

CPT palette tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The color palette table files, or just CPT tables, contain colors and
patterns used for plotting data such as surfaces (i.e., *GMT* grids) or
symbols, lines and polygons (i.e., *GMT* tables). *GMT* programs will
generally read in a CPT palette table, make it the current palette, do
the plotting, and destroy the table when done. The information is
referred to via a pointer to ``struct GMT_PALETTE``. Thus, the arguments
to *GMT* API functions that handle palettes expect this type of
variable. It is not expected that users will wish to manipulate a CPT
table directly, but rather use this mechanism to hold them in memory and
pass as arguments to *GMT* modules.

GMT images
~~~~~~~~~~

*GMT* images are used to represent bit-mapped images typically obtained
via the GDAL bridge. These can be reprojected internally, such as when
used in grdimage. Since images and grids share the concept of a header,
we use the same header structure for grids as for images; however, some
additional metadata attributes are also needed. Finally, the image
itself may be of any data type and have more than one band (channel).
Both image and header information are passed via a ``struct GMT_IMAGE``,
which is a container that holds both items. Thus, the arguments to
*GMT* API functions that handle *GMT* images expect this type of
variable. Unlike the other objects, writting images has only partial
support via ``GMT_grdimage`` [4]_.

.. _tbl-image:

.. code-block:: c

  struct GMT_IMAGE {
      enum GMT_enum_type type;          /* Data type, e.g. GMT_FLOAT */
      int		*ColorMap;      /* Array with color lookup values */
      struct GMT_GRID_HEADER *header;	/* Pointer to full GMT header for the image */
      unsigned char   *data;            /* Pointer to actual image */
      /* ---- Variables "hidden" from the API ---- */
      unsigned int id;                  /* The internal number of the data set */
      enum GMT_enum_alloc alloc_mode;   /* Allocation info [0] */
      unsigned int alloc_level;         /* Level of initial allocation */
      const char      *ColorInterp;
  };

User data columns (GMT vectors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Programs that wish to call *GMT* modules may hold data in their own
particular data structures. For instance, the user’s program may have
three column arrays of type float and wishes to use these as the input
source to the ``GMT_surface`` module, which normally expects double
precision triplets via a ``struct GMT_DATASET`` read from a file or
given by memory reference. Simply create a new ``struct GMT_VECTOR``
(see section [sec:create]) and assign the union array pointers (see
:ref:`univector <tbl-univector>`) to your data columns and provide the required
information on length, data types, and optionally range (see
Table :ref:`vector <tbl-vector>`). By letting the *GMT* module know you are passing a
data set *via* a ``struct GMT_VECTOR`` it will know how to read the data correctly.

.. _tbl-univector:

.. code-block:: c

  union GMT_UNIVECTOR { 
      uint8_t  *uc1;       /* Pointer for unsigned 1-byte array */ 
      uint8_t  *uc1;       /* Pointer for unsigned 1-byte array */ 
      int8_t   *sc1;       /* Pointer for signed 1-byte array */
      uint16_t *ui2;       /* Pointer for unsigned 2-byte array */
      int16_t  *si2;       /* Pointer for signed 2-byte array */
      uint32_t *ui4;       /* Pointer for unsigned 4-byte array */
      int32_t  *si4;       /* Pointer for signed 4-byte array */
      uint64_t *ui8;       /* Pointer for unsigned 8-byte array */
      int64_t  *si8;       /* Pointer for signed 8-byte array */
      float    *f4;        /* Pointer for float array */
      double   *f8;        /* Pointer for double array */
  };

.. _tbl-vector:

.. code-block:: c

  struct GMT_VECTOR {
      uint64_t             n_columns;     /* Number of vectors */
      uint64_t             n_rows;        /* Number of rows in each vector */
      enum GMT_enum_type  *type;          /* Array with data type for each vector */
      double               range[2];      /* The min and max limits on t-range (or 0,0) */
      union GMT_UNIVECTOR *data;          /* Array with unions for each column */
      unsigned int         id;            /* An identification number */
      enum GMT_enum_alloc  alloc_mode;    /* Determines if we may free the vectors or not */
      unsigned int alloc_level;           /* Level of initial allocation */
  };


User data matrices (GMT matrices)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _tbl-matrix:

.. code-block:: c

  struct GMT_MATRIX {
      uint64_t n_rows;                    /* Number of rows in the matrix */
      uint64_t n_columns;                 /* Number of columns in the matrix */
      unsigned int n_layers;              /* Number of layers in a 3-D matrix */
      unsigned int shape;                 /* 0 = C (rows) and 1 = Fortran (cols) */
      unsigned int registration;          /* 0 for gridline and 1 for pixel registration */
      size_t dim;                         /* Length of dimension for row (C) or column (Fortran) */
      size_t size;                        /* Byte length of data */
      enum GMT_enum_alloc alloc_mode;     /* Determines if we may free the vectors or not */
      double range[6];                    /* The min and max limits on x-, y-, and z-ranges */
      union GMT_UNIVECTOR data;           /* Union with pointers a data matrix of any type */
      /* ---- Variables "hidden" from the API ---- */
      unsigned int id;                    /* An identification number */
      unsigned int alloc_level;           /* Level of initial allocation */
      enum GMT_enum_type type;            /* The matrix data type */
  };


Likewise, programs may have an integer 2-D matrix in memory and wish to
use that as the input grid to the ``GMT_grdfilter`` module, which
normally expects a ``struct GMT_GRID`` with floating point data via a
file or provided by memory reference. As for user vectors, we create a
``struct GMT_MATRIX`` (see section [sec:create]), assign the appropriate
union pointer to your data matrix and provide information on dimensions
and data type (see Table :ref:`matrix <tbl-matrix>`). Let the *GMT* module know you
are passing a grid via a ``struct GMT_MATRIX`` and it will know how to
read the matrix properly.

Overview of the GMT C Application Program Interface
===================================================


Users who wish to create their own *GMT* application based on the API
must make sure their program goes through the steps below; details for
each step will be revealed in the following chapter. We have kept the
API simple: In addition to the *GMT* modules, there are only 52 public
functions to become familiar with, but most applications will only use a
small subset of this selection. Functions either return an integer error
code (when things go wrong; otherwise it is set to GMT_OK (0)), or they
return a void pointer to a *GMT* resources (or NULL if things go wrong).
In either case the API will report what the error is. The layout here
assumes you wish to use data in memory as input sources; if the data are
simply command-line files then things simplify considerably.

#. Initialize a new *GMT* session with ``GMT_Create_Session``, which
   allocates a hidden *GMT* API control structure and returns an opaque
   pointer to it. This pointer is the first argument to all subsequent
   *GMT* API function calls within the session.

#. For each intended call to a *GMT* module, several steps are involved:

   a. Register input sources and output destination with ``GMT_Register_IO``.

   b. Each resource registration generates a unique ID number. For
      memory resources, we embed these numbers in unique filenames of
      the form "@GMTAPI@-######". When *GMT* i/o library functions
      encounter such filenames they extract the ID and make a connection
      to the corresponding resource. Multiple table data or text sources
      are combined into a single virtual source for *GMT* modules to
      operate on. In contrast, CPT, Grid, and Image resources are
      operated on individually.

   c. Enable data import once all registrations are complete.

   d. Read data into memory. You may choose to read everything at once
      or read record-by-record (tables only).

   e. Prepare required arguments and call the *GMT* module you wish to use.

   f. Process any results returned to memory via pointers rather than
      written to files.

   g. Destroy the resources allocated by *GMT* modules to hold results,
      or let the garbage collector do this automatically at the end of
      the module and at the end of the session.

#. Repeat steps a–f as many times as your application requires.

#. We terminate the GMT session by calling ``GMT_Destroy_Session``.

The steps a–d collapse into a single step if data are simply read from files.

Advanced programs may be calling more than one *GMT* session and thus
run several sessions, perhaps concurrently as different threads on
multi-core machines. We will now discuss these steps in more detail.
Throughout, we will introduce upper-case *GMT* C enum constants *in
lieu* of simple integer constants. These are considered part of the API
and are available for developers via the ``gmt_resources.h`` include file.

The C/C++ API is deliberately kept small to make it easy to use.
Table [tbl:API] gives a list of all the functions and their purpose.

The GMT C Application Program Interface
=======================================

Initialize a new GMT session
----------------------------

Most applications will need to initialize only a single *GMT* session.
This is true of all the standard *GMT* programs since they only call one
*GMT* module and then exit. Most user-developed *GMT* applications are
likely to only initialize one session even though they may call many
*GMT* modules. However, the *GMT* API supports any number of
simultaneous sessions should the programmer wish to take advantage of
it. This might be useful when you have access to several CPUs and want
to spread the computing load [5]_. In the following discussion we will
simplify our treatment to the use of a single session only.

To initiate the new session we use

.. _GMT_Create_Session:

  ::

    void *GMT_Create_Session (char *tag, unsigned int pad, unsigned int mode,
                              int (*print_func) (FILE *, const char *));

and you will typically call it thus:

  ::

    void *API = NULL;
    API = GMT_Create_Session ("Session name", 2, 0, NULL);

where ``API`` is an opaque pointer to the hidden *GMT* API control
structure. You will need to pass this pointer to *all* subsequent
*GMT* API functions; this is how essential internal information is
passed from module to module. The key task of this initialization is to
set up the *GMT* machinery and its internal variables used for map
projections, plotting, i/o, etc. The initialization also allocates space
for internal structures used to register resources. The ``pad`` argument
sets how many rows and columns should be used for padding for grids and
images so that boundary conditions can be applied. *GMT* uses 2 so we
recommend that value. The ``mode`` argument is only used for external APIs
that need to replace GMT's calls to a hard exit upon failure with a soft return. Likewise,
the *print_func* argument is a pointer to a function that is used to print
messages via GMT_Message or GMT_Report from APIs that cannot use the
standard printf (this is the case for the Matlab API, for instance).
All other uses should simply pass 0 and NULL for these two arguments.
Should something go wrong then ``API`` will be returned as ``NULL``.

Register input or output resources
----------------------------------

When using the standard *GMT* programs, you specify input files on the
command line or via special program options (e.g.,
**-I**\ *intensity.nc*). The output of the programs are either written
to standard output (which you redirect to files or pipe to other
programs) or to files specified by specific program options (e.g.,
**-G**\ *output.nc*). Alternatively, the *GMT* API allows you to specify
input (and output) to be associated with open file handles or program
variables. We will examine this more closely below. Registering a
resource is a required step before attempting to import or export data
that *do not* come from files or standard input/output.

Resource registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registration involves a direct or indirect call to

.. _GMT_Register_IO:

  ::

    int GMT_Register_IO (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int method,
                         unsigned int geometry, unsigned int direction, 
                         double wesn[], void *ptr);

where :ref:`family <tbl-family>` specifies what kind of resource is to be registered,
``method`` specifies
how we to access this resource (see Table :ref:`methods <tbl-methods>` for recognized
methods, as well as modifiers you can add; these are listed in Table
:ref:`via <tbl-via>`), :ref:`geometry <tbl-geometry>` specifies the geometry of the data (see Table
:ref:`geometry <tbl-geometry>` for recognized geometries), ``ptr`` is the address of the
pointer to the named resource. If ``direction`` is GMT_OUT and the
``method`` is not related to a file (filename, stream, or handle), then
``ptr`` must be NULL. After the *GMT* module has written the data you
can use GMT_Retrieve_Data_ to assign a pointer to the memory location
(variable) where the output was allocated. For grid (and image)
resources you may request to obtain a subset via the :ref:`wesn <tbl-wesn>` array (see
Table :ref:`wesn <tbl-wesn>` for information); otherwise, pass NULL to obtain the
entire grid (or image). The ``direction`` indicates input or output and
is either GMT_IN (0) or GMT_OUT (1). Finally, the function returns a
unique resource ID, or GMT_NOTSET (-1) if there was an error.

Object ID encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use registered resources as program input or output arguments you
must pass them via a text string that acts as a special file name
(Chapter [ch:overview]). The proper filename formatting is guaranteed by
using the function

.. _GMT_Encode_ID:

  ::

    int GMT_Encode_ID (void *API, char *filename, int ID);

which accepts the unique ``ID`` and writes the corresponding
``filename``. The variable ``filename`` must have enough space to hold
16 bytes. The function returns TRUE (1) if there is an error; otherwise
it returns FALSE (0).

Resource initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All *GMT* programs dealing with input or output files given on the
command line, and perhaps defaulting to the standard input or output
streams if no files are given, must call the i/o initializer function
``GMT_Init_IO`` once for each direction required (i.e., input and output
separately). For input it determines how many input sources have already
been registered. If none has been registered then it scans the program
arguments for any filenames given on the command line and register these
input resources. Finally, if we still have found no input sources we
assign the standard input stream as the single input source. For output
it is similar: If no single destination has been registered we specify
the standard output stream as the output destination. Only one main
output destination is allowed to be active when a module writes data
(some modules also write additional output via program-specific
options). The prototype for this function is

.. _GMT_Init_IO:

  ::

    int GMT_Init_IO (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int geometry,
                     unsigned int direction, unsigned int mode,
                     unsigned int n_args, void *args);

where ``family`` specifies what kind of resource is to be registered,
``geometry`` specifies the geometry of the data, ``direction`` is either
``GMT_IN`` or ``GMT_OUT``, and ``mode`` is a bit flag that determines
what we do if no resources have been registered. The choices are

    **1** (or GMT_ADD_FILES_IF_NONE) means "add command line (option)
    files if none have been registered already"

    **2** (or GMT_ADD_FILES_ALWAYS) means "always add any command line files"

    **4** (or GMT_ADD_STDIO_IF_NONE) means "add std\* if no other
    input/output have been specified"

    **8** (or GMT_ADD_STDIO_ALWAYS) means "always add std\* even if
    resources have been registered".

    **16** (or GMT_ADD_EXISTING) means "only use already registered resources".

The standard behavior is 5 (or GMT_REG_DEFAULT). Next, ``n_args`` is 0
if ``args`` is the head of a linked list of options (further discussed
in Section [sec:func]); otherwise ``args`` is an array of ``n_args``
strings (i.e., the int argc, char \*argv[] model)

Many programs will register an export location where results of a
*GMT* function (say, a filtered grid) should be returned, but may then
wish to use that variable as an *input* resource in a subsequent module
call. This is accomplished by re-registering the resource as an *input*
source, thereby changing the *direction* of the data set. The function
returns TRUE (1) if there is an error; otherwise it returns FALSE (0).

Dimension parameters for user 1-D column vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We refer to Table [tbl:vector]. The ``type`` array must hold the data
type of each data column in the user’s program. All types other than
GMT_DOUBLE will be converted internally in *GMT* to ``double``, thus
possibly increasing memory requirements. If the type is GMT_DOUBLE then
*GMT* will be able to use the column directly by reference. The
``n_columns`` and ``n_rows`` parameters indicate the number of vectors
and their common length. If these are not yet known you may pass 0 for
these values and set ``alloc_mode`` to GMT_ALLOCATED_BY_GMT (1); this will
make sure *GMT* will allocate the necessary memory to the variable you
specify.

Dimension parameters for user 2-D table arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We refer to Table [tbl:matrix]. The ``type`` parameter specifies the
data type used for the array in the user's program. All types other than
GMT_FLOAT will be converted internally in *GMT* to ``float``, thus
possibly increasing memory requirements. If the type is GMT_FLOAT then
*GMT* may be able to use the matrix directly by reference. The
``n_rows`` and ``n_columns`` parameters indicate the dimensions of the
matrix. If these are not yet known you may pass 0 for these values and
set ``alloc_mode`` to GMT_ALLOCATED_BY_GMT (1); this will make sure *GMT* will
allocate the necessary memory at the location you specify. Fortran users
will instead have to specify a size large enough to hold the anticipated
output data. The ``registration`` and ``range`` gives the grid
registration and domain. Finally, use ``dim`` to indicate if the memory
matrix has a dimension that exceeds that of the leading row (or column)
dimension. Note: For GMT_IS_TEXTSET the user matrix is expected to be
a 2-D character array with a fixed row length of ``dim`` but we only
consider the first ``n_columns`` characters. For data grids you will
also need to specify the ``registration`` (see the *GMT* Cookbook and
Reference, Appendix B for description of the two forms of registration)
and data domain ``range``.

Create empty resources
----------------------


If your application needs to build and populate *GMT* resources in ways
that do not depend on external resources (files, memory locations,
etc.), then youGMT_Create_Data can obtain a “blank slate” by calling

.. _GMT_Create_Data:

  ::

    void *GMT_Create_Data (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int geometry,
                           unsigned int mode, uint64_t par[], double *wesn, 
                           double *inc, unsigned int registration, int pad, void *data)

which returns a pointer to the allocated resource. Pass ``family`` as
one of GMT_IS_GRID, GMT_IS_IMAGE, GMT_IS_DATASET,
GMT_IS_TEXTSET, or GMT_IS_CPT, or via the modifiers GMT_IS_VECTOR
or GMT_IS_MATRIX when handling user data. Also pass a compatible
``geometry``. Depending on the family and your particular way of
representing dimensions you may pass the additional parameters in one of
two ways:

#. Actual integer dimensions of items needed.

#. Physical distances and increments of each dimension.

For method (1), pass the ``par`` array, as indicated below:

**GMT_IS_GRID**
    An empty GMT_GRID structure with a header is allocated; the data
    array is NULL. The ``par`` argument is not used.

**GMT_IS_IMAGE**
    An empty GMT_GRID structure with a header is allocated; the image
    array is NULL. The ``par`` argument is not used.

**GMT_IS_DATASET**
    An empty GMT_DATASET structure consisting of ``par[0]`` tables,
    each with ``par[1]`` segments, each with ``par[2]`` rows, all
    with ``par[3]`` columns, is allocated.

**GMT_IS_TEXTSET**
    An empty GMT_TEXTSET structure consisting of ``par[0]`` tables,
    each with ``par[1]`` segments, all with ``par[2]`` text records (rows), is allocated.

**GMT_IS_CPT**
    An empty GMT_PALETTE structure with ``par[0]`` palette entries is allocated.

**GMT_IS_VECTOR**
    An empty GMT_VECTOR structure with ``par[0]`` column entries is allocated.

**GMT_IS_MATRIX**
    An empty GMT_MATRIX structure is allocated. ``par[3]`` indicates
    the number of layers for a 3-D matrix, or pass 0, 1, or NULL for a 2-D matrix.

In this case, pass ``wesn``, ``inc`` as NULL. For method (2), you
instead pass ``wesn``, ``inc``, and ``registration`` and leave as NULL.
For grids and images you may pass ``pad`` to set the padding, or -1 to
accept the *GMT* default. The ``mode`` determines what is actually
allocated when you have chosen grids or images. As for GMT_Read_Data_
you can pass ``GMT_GRID_ALL`` to initialize the header and allocate
space for the array. Alternatively, you can pass
``GMT_GRID_HEADER_ONLY`` to just initialize the grid or image header,
and call a second time, passing ``GMT_GRID_DATA_ONLY``, to allocate
space for the array. In that second call you pass the pointer returned
by the first call as ``data`` and specify the family; all other
arguments should be NULL or 0. Normally, resources created by this
function are considered to be input (i.e., have a direction that is GMT_IN).
You can change that to GMT_OUT by adding in the bit flag GMT_VIA_OUTPUT.
The function returns a pointer to the
data container. In case of an error we return a NULL pointer and pass an
error code via ``API->error``.

Duplicate resources
-------------------


Often you have read or created a data resource and then need an
identical copy, presumably to make modifications to. Or, you want a copy
with the same dimensions and allocated memory, except data values should
not be duplicated. Alternatively, perhaps you just want to duplicate the
header and skip the allocation and duplication of the data. These tasks
are addressed by

.. _GMT_Duplicate_Data:

  ::

    void *GMT_Duplicate_Data (void *API, unsigned int family,
                              unsigned int mode, void *data);

which returns a pointer to the allocated resource. Specify which
``family`` and select ``mode`` from ``GMT_DUPLICATE_DATA``,
``GMT_DUPLICATE_ALLOC``, and ``GMT_DUPLICATE_NONE``, as discussed above
(also see ``mode`` discussion above).
The ``data`` is a pointer to the resource you wish to duplicate. In case
of an error we return a NULL pointer and pass an error code via
``API->error``.

Get resource ID
---------------


Resources created by these two methods can be used as in various ways.
Sometimes you want to pass them as input to other modules, in which
case you need to registration ID of that resource. This task
are performed by

.. _GMT_Get_ID:

  ::

    void *GMT_Get_ID (void *API, unsigned int family,
                              unsigned int direction, void *data);

which returns the ID number of the allocated resource. Specify which
``family`` and select ``direction`` from ``GMT_IN`` or ``GMT_OUT``.
The ``data`` is a pointer to the resource you whose ID you need. In case
of an error we return GMT_NOTSET (-1) and pass an error code via
``API->error``.

Import Data
-----------

If your main program needs to read any of the five recognized data types
(CPT files, data tables, text tables, *GMT* grids, or images) you will
use the GMT_Get_Data_ or GMT_Read_Data_ functions, which both
return entire data sets. In the case of data and text tables you may
also select record-by-record reading using the GMT_Get_Record_
function. As a general rule, your program development simplifies if you
can read entire resources into memory with GMT_Get_Data_ or
GMT_Read_Data_ However, if this leads to unacceptable memory usage
or if the program logic is particularly simple, you may obtain one data
record at the time via GMT_Get_Record_

All input functions takes a parameter called ``mode``. The ``mode``
parameter generally has different meanings for the different data types
and will be discussed below. However, one bit setting is common to all
types: By default, you are only allowed to read a data source once; the
source is then flagged as having been read and subsequent attempts to
read from the same source will result in a warning and no reading takes
place. In the unlikely event you need to re-read a source you can
override this default behavior by adding GMT_IO_RESET to your ``mode``
parameter. Note that this override does not apply to sources that are
streams or file handles, as it may not be possible to re-read their
contents.

Enable Data Import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all input resources have been registered, we signal the API that we
are done with the registration phase and are ready to start the actual
data import. This step is only required when reading one record at the
time. We initialize record-by-record reading by calling
GMT_Begin_IO_ This function enables dataset and textset
record-by-record reading and prepares the registered sources for the
upcoming import. The prototype is

.. _GMT_Begin_IO:

  ::

    int GMT_Begin_IO (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int direction,
                      unsigned int mode, unsigned int header);

where ``family`` specifies the resource type to be read or written (see
Table [tbl:family]; only GMT_IS_DATASET and GMT_IS_TEXTSET are
available for record-by-record handling). The ``direction`` is either
GMT_IN or GMT_out, so for import we obviously use GMT_IN. The
function determines the first input source and sets up procedures for
skipping to the next input source in a virtual data set. The
GMT_Get_Record_ function will not be able to read any data before
GMT_Begin_IO_ has been called. As you might guess, there is a
companion GMT_End_IO_ function that completes, then disables
record-by-record data access. You can use these several times to switch
modes between registering data resources, doing the importing/exporting,
and disabling further data access, perhaps to do more registration. We
will discuss GMT_End_IO_ once we are done with the data import. The
``mode`` option is used to allow output to write table header
information (``GMT_HEADER_ON``) or not (``GMT_HEADER_OFF``). This is
usually on unless you are writing messages and other non-data. The final
``header`` argument determines if the common header-block should be
written during initialization; choose between ``GMT_HEADER_ON`` (1) and
``GMT_HEADER_OFF`` (0). The function returns TRUE (1) if there is an
error; otherwise it returns FALSE (0).

Import a data set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your program needs to import any of the five recognized data types
(CPT table, data table, text table, *GMT* grid, or image) you will use
either the GMT_Read_Data_ or GMT_Get_Data_ functions. The former
is typically used when reading from files, streams (e.g., ``stdin``), or
an open file handle, while the latter is only used with a registered
resource via its unique ID. Because of the similarities of these five
import functions we use an generic form that covers all of them.

Import from a file, stream, or handle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To read an entire resource from a file, stream, or file handle, use

.. _GMT_Read_Data:

  ::

    void *GMT_Read_Data (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int method,
                         unsigned int geometry, unsigned int mode, double wesn[],
                         char *input, void *ptr);

* API -- None of your business
* :ref:`family <tbl-family>`
* :ref:`method <tbl-methods>`
* :ref:`geometry <tbl-geometry>`
* :ref:`wesn <tbl-wesn>`

.. function:: void *GMT_Read_Data (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int method,
                      unsigned int geometry, unsigned int mode, double wesn[],
                      char *input, void *ptr);

   :param API: None of your business
   :param family: :ref:`family <tbl-family>`
   :rtype: None (void)

where ``ptr`` is NULL except when reading grids in two steps (i.e.,
first get a grid structure with a header, then read the data). Most of
these arguments have been discussed earlier. This function can be called
in three different situations:

#. If you have a single source (filename, stream pointer, etc.) you can
   call GMT_Read_Data_ directly; there is no need to first register
   the source with GMT_Register_IO_ or gather the sources with
   GMT_Init_IO_. However, if you did register a single source you can
   still pass it via an encoded filename (see GMT_Encode_ID_) or you
   can instead use GMT_Get_Data_ using the integer ID directly (see
   next section).

#. If you want to specify ``stdin`` as source then use ``input`` as NULL.

#. If you already registered all desired sources with GMT_Init_IO_
   then you indicate this by passing ``geometry`` = 0.

Space will be allocated to hold the results, if needed, and a pointer to
the object is returned. If there are errors we simply return NULL and
report the error. The ``mode`` parameter has different meanings for
different data types.

**CPT table**
    ``mode`` contains bit-flags that control how the CPT file’s back-,
    fore-, and NaN-colors should be initialized. Select 0 to use the CPT
    file’s back-, fore-, and NaN-colors, 2 to replace these with the
    *GMT* default values, or 4 to replace them with the color table’s
    entries for highest and lowest value.

**Data table**
    ``mode`` is currently not used.

**Text table**
    ``mode`` is currently not used.

**GMT grid**
    Here, ``mode`` determines how we read the grid: To read the entire
    grid and its header, pass GMT_GRID_ALL. However, if you need to
    extract a sub-region you must first read the header by passing
    GMT_GRID_HEADER_ONLY, then examine the header structure range
    attributes and to specify a subset via the array ``wesn``, and
    finally call GMT_Read_Data_ a second time, now with ``mode`` =
    GMT_GRID_DATA_ONLY and passing your ``wesn`` array and the grid
    structure returned from the first call as ``ptr``. In the event your
    data array should be allocated to hold both the real and imaginary
    parts of a complex data set you must add either
    GMT_GRID_IS_COMPLEX_REAL or GMT_GRID_IS_COMPLEX_IMAG to
    ``mode`` so as to allow for the extra memory needed and to stride
    the input values correctly. If your grid is huge and you must read
    it row-by-row, set ``mode`` to GMT_GRID_HEADER_ONLY \|
    GMT_GRID_ROW_BY_ROW. You can then access the grid row-by-row
    using GMT_Get_Row_ By default the rows will be automatically
    processed in order. To completely specify which row to be read, use
    GMT_GRID_ROW_BY_ROW_MANUAL instead.

Import from a memory location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are importing via variables or prefer to first register the
source, then you should use GMT_Get_Data_ instead. This function
requires fewer arguments since you simply pass the unique ID number of
the resource. The function is described as follows:

.. _GMT_Get_Data:

  ::

    void *GMT_Get_Data (void *API, int ID, unsigned int mode, void *ptr);

The ``ID`` is the unique object ID you received when registering the
resource, ``mode`` controls some aspects of the import (see
GMT_Read_Data_ above), while ``ptr`` is NULL except when reading
grids in two steps (i.e., first get a grid structure with a header, then
read the data). Other arguments have been discussed earlier. Space will
be allocated to hold the results, if needed, and a pointer to the object
is returned. If there are errors we simply return NULL and report the error.

Retrieve an allocated result
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, if you need to access the result that a GMT module wrote to a
memory location, then you must register an output destination with
GMT_Register_IO_ first (passing ``ptr`` == NULL). The GMT module will
then allocate space to hold the output and let the API know where this
memory resides. You can then use GMT_Retrieve_Data_ to get a pointer
to the container where the data set was stored. This function requires
fewer arguments since you simply pass the unique ID number of the
resource. The function is described as follows:

.. _GMT_Retrieve_Data:

  ::

    void *GMT_Retrieve_Data (void *API, int ID);

The ``ID`` is the unique object ID you received when registering the
NULL resource earlier, Since this container has already been created, a
pointer to the object is returned. If there are errors we simply return
NULL and report the error.

Importing a data record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your program will read data table records one-by-one you must first
enable this input mechanism with GMT_Begin_IO_ and then read the
records in a loop using

.. _GMT_Get_Record:

  ::

    void *GMT_Get_Record (void *API, unsigned int mode, int *nfields);

where the returned value is either a pointer to a double array with the
current row values or to a character string with the current row,
depending on ``mode``. In either case these pointers point to memory
internal to *GMT* and should be considered read-only. When we reach
end-of-file, encounter conversion problems, read header comments, or
identify segment headers we return a NULL pointer. The ``nfields``
pointer will return the number of fields returned; pass NULL if your
program should ignore this information.

Normally (``mode`` == GMT_READ_DOUBLE or 0), we return a pointer to
the double array. To read text records, supply instead ``mode`` ==
GMT_READ_TEXT (or 1) and we instead return a pointer to the text
record. However, if you have input records that mixes organized
floating-point columns with text items you could pass ``mode`` ==
GMT_READ_MIXED (2). Then, *GMT* will attempt to extract the
floating-point values; you can still access the record string, as
discussed below. Finally, if your application needs to be notified when
*GMT* closes one file and opens the next, add GMT_FILE_BREAK to
``mode`` and check for the status code GMT_IO_NEXT_FILE (by default,
we treat the concatenation of many input files as a single virtual
file). Using ``GMT_Get_Record`` requires you to first initialize the
source(s) with ``GMT_Init_IO``. For certain records, ``GMT_Get_Record``
will return NULL and sets status codes that your program will need to
examine to take appropriate response. Table [tbl:iostatus] list the
various status codes you can check for, using ``GMT_Status_IO`` (see
next section).

Examining record status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Programs that read record-by-record must be aware of what the current
record represents. Given the presence of headers, data gaps, NaN-record,
etc. the developer will want to check the status after reading the next
record. The internal i/o status mode can be interrogated with the function

.. _GMT_Status_IO:

  ::

    int GMT_Status_IO (void *API, unsigned int mode);

which returns 0 (false) or 1 (true) if the current status is reflected
by the specified ``mode``. There are 11 different modes available to
programmers; for a list see Table [tbl:iostatus]. For an example of how
these may be used, see the test program ``testgmtio.c``. Developers who plan to import
data on a record-by-record basis may also consult the source code of,
say, ``blockmean.c`` or ``pstext.c``, to see examples of working code.

.. _tbl-iostatus:

+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| mode                        | description                                              |

+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+


Importing a grid row
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your program must read a grid file row-by-row you must first enable
row-by-row reading with ``GMT_Read_Data`` and then use the
``GMT_Get_Row`` function in a loop; the prototype is

.. _GMT_Get_Row:

  ::

    int GMT_Get_Row (void *API, int row_no, struct GMT_GRID *G, float *row);

where ``row`` is a pointer to a single-precision array to receive the
current row, ``G`` is the grid in question, and ``row_no`` is the number
of the current row to be read. Note this value is only considered if the
row-by-row mode was initialized with GMT_GRID_ROW_BY_ROW_MANUAL.
The user must allocate enough space to hold the entire row in memory.

Disable Data Import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the record-by-record input processing has completed we disable
further input to prevent accidental reading from occurring (due to poor
program structure, bugs, etc.). We do so by calling ``GMT_End_IO``. This
function disables further record-by-record data import; its prototype is

.. _GMT_End_IO:

  ::

    int GMT_End_IO (void *API, unsigned int direction, unsigned int mode);

and we specify ``direction`` = GMT_IN. At the moment, ``mode`` is not
used. This call will also reallocate any arrays obtained into their
proper lengths. The function returns TRUE (1) if there is an error
(which is passed back with ``API->error``), otherwise it returns FALSE (0).

Manipulate data
---------------

[sec:manipulate]

Once you have created and allocated and empty resources, or read in
resources from the outside, you will wish to manipulate their contents.
This section discusses how to set up loops and access the important
variables for the various data families. For grids and images it may
be required to know what the coordinates are at each node point.  This
can be obtained via arrays of coordinates for each dimension, obtained by

.. _GMT_Get_Coord:

  ::

    double *GMT_Get_Coord (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int dim, void *data);

where ``family`` must be GMT_IS_GRID or GMT_IS_DATASET, ``dim`` is either
GMT_IS_X or GMT_IS_Y, and ``data`` is the grid or image pointer.  This
function will be used below in our example on grid manipulation.

Another aspect of dealing with grids and images is to convert a row and column
2-D reference to our 1-D array index.  Because of grid and image boundary padding
the relationship is not straightforward, hence we supply

.. _GMT_Get_Index:

  ::

    int64_t GMT_Get_Index (struct GMT_GRID_HEADER *header, int row, int col);

where the ``header`` is the header of either a grid or image, and ``row`` and
``col`` is the 2-D position in the grid or image.  We return the 1-D array
position; again this function is used below in our example.


Manipulate grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most applications wishing to manipulate grids will want to loop over all
the nodes, typically in a manner organized by rows and columns. In doing
so, the coordinates at each node may also be required for a calculation.
Below is a snippet of code that shows how to do visit all nodes in a
grid and assign each node the product x \* y:

  ::

    int row, col, node;
    double *x_coord = NULL, *y_coord = NULL;
    < ... create a grid G or read one ... >
    x_coord = GMT_Get_Coord (API, GMT_IS_GRID, GMT_X, G);
    y_coord = GMT_Get_Coord (API, GMT_IS_GRID, GMT_Y, G);
    for (row = 0; row < G->header->ny) {
        for (col = 0; col < G->header->nx; col++) {
            node = GMT_Get_Index (G->header, row, col);
            G->data[node] = x_coord[col] * y_coord[row];
        }
    }

Note the use of ``GMT_Get_Index`` to get the grid node number associated
with the ``row`` and ``col`` we are visiting. Because *GMT* grids have
padding (for boundary conditions) the relationship between rows,
columns, and node indices is more complicated and hence we hide that
complexity in ``GMT_Get_Index``. Note that for trivial procedures such
setting all grid nodes to a constant (e.g., -9999.0) where the row and
column does not enter you can instead do a single loop:

  ::

    int node;
    < ... create a grid G or read one ... >
    for (node = 0; node < G->header->size) G->data[node] = -9999.0;

Note we must use ``G->header->size`` (size of allocated array) and not
``G->header->nm`` (number of nodes in grid) since the latter is smaller
due to the padding and a single loop like the above treats the pad as
part of the “inside” grid.

Manipulate data tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another common application is to process the records in a data table.
Because *GMT* consider the GMT_DATASET resources to contain one or more
tables, each of which may contain one or more segments, all of which may
contain one or more columns, you will need to have multiple loops to
visit all entries. The following code snippet will visit all data
records and add 1 to all columns beyond the first two (x and y):

  ::

    int tbl, seg, row, col;
    struct GMT_DATATABLE *T = NULL;
    struct GMT_DATASEGMENT *S = NULL;

    < ... create a dataset D or read one ... >
    for (tbl = 0; tbl < D->n_tables; tbl++) {       /* For each table */
      T = D->table[tbl];       /* Convenient shorthand for current table */
      for (seg = 0; seg < T->n_segments; seg++) {   /* For all segments */
        S = T->segment[seg];   /* Convenient shorthand for current segment */
        for (row = 0; row < S->n_rows; row++) {
          for (col = 2; col < T->n_columns; col++) {
            S->coord[col][row] += 1.0;
          }
        }
      }
    }

Manipulate text tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When data file contain text mixed in with numbers you must open the file
as a GMT_TEXTSET and do your own parsing of the data records. The
following code snippet will visit all text records and print them out:

  ::

    int tbl, seg, row, col;
    struct GMT_TEXTTABLE *T = NULL;
    struct GMT_TEXTSEGMENT *S = NULL;

    < ... create a textset D or read one ... >
    for (tbl = 0; tbl < D->n_tables; tbl++) {   /* For each table */
      T = D->table[tbl];        /* Convenient shorthand for current table */
      for (seg = 0; seg < T->n_segments; seg++) {   /* For all segments */
        S = T->segment[seg];    /* Convenient shorthand for current segment */
        for (row = 0; row < S->n_rows; row++) {
          printf ("T=%d S=%d R=%d : %s\n", tbl, seg, row, S->record[row]);
        }
      }
    }

Message and Verbose Reporting
-----------------------------

The API provides two functions for your program to present information
to the user during the run of the program. One is used for messages that
are always written while the other is used for reports that must exceed
the verbosity settings specified via **-V**.

.. _GMT_Report:

  ::

    int GMT_Report (void *API, unsigned int level, char *message, ...);

This function takes a verbosity level and a multi-part message (e.g., a
format statement and zero or more variables). The verbosity ``level`` is
an integer in the 0–5 range; these are listed in Table [tbl:verbosity].
You assign an appropriate verbosity level to your message, and depending
on the chosen run-time verbosity level set via **-V** your message may
or may not be reported. Only messages whose stated verbosity level is
lower or equal to the **-V**\ *level* will be printed.


.. _tbl-verbosity:

+-------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| constant                | value | description                                      |
+=========================+=======+==================================================+
| GMT_MSG_QUIET           | 0     | No messages whatsoever                           |
+-------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_MSG_NORMAL          | 1     | Default output, e.g., warnings and errors only   |
+-------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_MSG_COMPAT          | 2     | Compatibility warnings                           |
+-------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_MSG_VERBOSE         | 3     | Verbose level                                    |
+-------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_MSG_LONG_VERBOSE    | 4     | Longer verbose                                   |
+-------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_MSG_DEBUG           | 5     | Debug messages for developers mostly             |
+-------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+


.. _GMT_Message:

  ::

    int GMT_Message (void *API, unsigned int mode, char *format, ...);

This function always prints its message to the standard output. Use the
``mode`` value to control if a time stamp should preface the message.
and if selected how the time information should be formatted. See
Table :ref:`timemodes <tbl-timemodes>` for the various modes.


.. _tbl-timemodes:

+--------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------+
| constant           | value | description                             |
+====================+=======+=========================================+
| GMT_TIME_NONE      | 0     | Display no time information             |
+--------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------+
| GMT_TIME_CLOCK     | 1     | Display current local time              |
+--------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------+
| GMT_TIME_ELAPSED   | 2     | Display elapsed time since last reset   |
+--------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------+
| GMT_TIME_RESET     | 3     | Reset the elapsed time to 0             |
+--------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------+


Presenting and accessing GMT options
------------------------------------

[sec:parsopt] As you develop a program you may need to rely on some of
the *GMT* common options. For instance, you may wish to have your
program present the ``-R`` option to the user, let *GMT*\ handle the
parsing, and examine the values. You may also wish to encode your own
custom options that may require you to parse user text into the
corresponding floating point dimensions, length, coordinates, time, etc.
The API provides several functions to simplify these tedious parsing
tasks. This section is intended to show how the programmer will obtain
information from the user that is necessary to do the task at hand
(e.g., special options to provide values and settings for the program).
In the following section we will concern ourselves with preparing
arguments for calling any of the *GMT* modules.

Display usage syntax for GMT common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can have your program menu display the standard usage message for a
*GMT* common option by calling the function

.. _GMT_Option:

  ::

    int GMT_Option (void *API, char *options);

where ``options`` is a comma-separated list of *GMT* common options
(e.g., “R,J,O,X”). You can repeat this function with different sets of
options in order to intersperse your own custom options with in an
overall alphabetical order; see any *GMT* module for examples of typical
layouts.

Parsing the GMT common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parsing of all *GMT* common option is done by

.. _GMT_Parse_Common:

  ::

    int GMT_Parse_Common (void *API, char *args, struct GMT_OPTION *list);

where ``args`` is a string of the common *GMT* options your program may
use. An error will be reported if any of the common *GMT* options fail
to parse, and if so we return TRUE; if not errors we return FALSE. All
other options, including file names, will be silently ignored. The
parsing will update the internal *GMT* information structure that
affects program operations.

Inquiring about the GMT common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API provide only a limited window into the full *GMT* machinery
accessible to the modules. You can determine if a particular common
option has been parsed and in some cases determine the values that was set with

.. _GMT_Get_Common:

  ::

    int GMT_Get_Common (void *API, unsigned int option, double *par);

where ``option`` is a single option character (e.g., ‘R’) and ``par`` is
a double array with at least a length of 6. If the particular option has
been parsed then the function returns the number of parameters passed
back via ``par``; otherwise we return -1. For instance, to determine if
the ``-R`` was set and what the resulting region was set to you may call

  ::

    if (GMT_Get_Common (API, 'R', wesn)) != -1) {
        /* wesn now contains the boundary information */
    }

The ``wesn`` array could now be passed to the various read and create
functions for *GMT* resources.

Parsing text values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your program may need to request values from the user, such as
distances, plot dimensions, coordinates, and other data. The conversion
from such text to actual distances, taking units into account, is
tedious to program. You can simplify this by using

.. _GMT_Get_Value:

  ::

    int GMT_Get_Value (void *API, char *arg, double par[]);

where ``arg`` is the text item with one or more values that are
separated by commas, spaces, or slashes, and ``par`` is an array long
enough to hold all the items you are parsing. The function returns the
number of items parsed, or -1 if there is an error. For instance, assume
the character string ``origin`` was given by the user as two geographic
coordinates separated by a slash (e.g., ``"35:45W/19:30:55.3S"``). We
obtain the two coordinates as decimal degrees by calling

  ::

    n = GMT_Get_Value (API, origin, pair);

Your program can now check that ``n`` equals 2 and then use the values
in ``pairs``. Note: Dimensions given with units of inches, cm, or points
are converted to the *GMT* default length unit (:ref:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT <PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT>`)
[cm], while distances given in km, nautical miles, miles, feet, or
survey feet are returned in meters. Arc lengths in minutes and seconds
are returned in decimal degrees, and date/time values are returned in
seconds since the epoch (1970).

Inquiring about a GMT default parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your program needs to determine one or more of the current
*GMT* default settings you can do so via

.. _GMT_Get_Default:

  ::

    int GMT_Get_Default (void *API, char *keyword, char *value);

where ``keyword`` is one such keyword (e.g., :ref:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT <PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT>`) and
``value`` must be a character array long enough to hold the answer.
Depending on what parameter you selected you could further convert it to
a numerical value with ``GMT_Get_Value`` or just use it in a text comparison.

Prepare module options
----------------------

[sec:func] One of the advantages of programming with the API is that you
have access to the high-level *GMT* modules. For example, if your
program must compute the distance from a point to all other points on
the node you can simply set up options and call ``GMT_grdmath`` to do it
for you and accept the result back as an input grid. All the module
interfaces are identical are looks like

.. _GMT_Call_Module:

  ::

    int GMT_Call_Module (void *API, const char *module, int mode, void *args);

Here, ``module`` can be any of the *GMT* modules, such as
``psxy`` or ``grdvolume``.  All GMT modules may be called with one of
three sets of ``args`` depending on ``mode``. The three modes differ in
how the options are passed to the module:

    *mode* == GMT_MODULE_EXIST [-3]
        Just print a brief one-line summary of the module; args should be NULL.
	If ``module`` equals NULL then we list summaries for all the modules.

    *mode* == GMT_MODULE_PURPOSE [-2]
        Just prints the purpose of the module; args should be NULL.

    *mode* == GMT_MODULE_OPT [-1]
        Expects ``args`` to be a pointer to a doubly-linked list of objects with individual
        options for the current program. We will see
        how API functions can help prepare such lists.

    *mode* == GMT_MODULE_CMD [0]
        Expects ``args`` to be a single text string with all required options.

    *mode > 0*
        Expects ``args`` to be an array of text options and ``mode`` to be a count of how many
        options are passed (i.e., the ``argc, argv[]`` model used by the *GMT* programs themselves).


If no module by the given name is found we return -1.

Set program options via text array arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``mode > 0`` we expect an array ``args`` of character
strings that each holds a single command line options (e.g.,
“-R120:30/134:45/8S/3N”) and interpret ``mode`` to be the count of how
many options are passed. This, of course, is almost exactly how the
stand-alone *GMT* programs are called (and reflects how they themselves
are activated internally). We call this the “argc–argv” mode. Depending
on how your program obtains the necessary options you may find that this
interface offers all you need.

Set program options via text command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``mode`` == 0 then ``args`` will be examined to see if it contains
several options within a single command string. If so we will break
these into separate options. This is useful if you wish to pass a single
string such as "-R120:30/134:45/8S/3N -JM6i mydata.txt -Sc0.2c". We call
this the "command" mode.

Set program options via linked structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The third, linked-list interface allows developers using higher-level
programming languages to pass all command options via a pointer to a
NULL-terminated, doubly-linked list of option structures, each
containing information about a single option. Here, instead of text
arguments we pass the pointer to the linked list of options mentioned
above, and ``mode`` must be passed as -1 (or any negative value). Using
this interface can be more involved since you need to generate the
linked list of program options; however, utility functions exist to
simplify its use. This interface is intended for programs whose internal
workings are better suited to generate such arguments – we call this the
“options” mode. The order in the list is not important as *GMT* will
sort it internally according to need. The option structure is defined below.

.. _options:

  ::

    struct GMT_OPTION {
        char               option;    /* Single character of the option (e.g., 'G' for -G) */
        char              *arg;       /* String pointer with arguments (NULL if not used) */
        struct GMT_OPTION *next;      /* Pointer to next option (NULL for last option) */
        struct GMT_OPTION *prev;      /* Pointer to previous option (NULL for first option) */
    };

Convert between text and linked structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assist programmers there are also two convenience functions that
allow you to convert between the two argument formats. They are

.. _GMT_Create_Options:

  ::

    struct GMT_OPTIONS *GMT_Create_Options (void *API, int argc, void *args);

This function accepts your array of text arguments (cast via a void
pointer), allocates the necessary space, performs the conversion, and
returns a pointer to the head of the linked list of program options.
However, in case of an error we return a NULL pointer and set
``API->error`` to indicate the nature of the problem. Otherwise, the
pointer may now be passed to the relevant ``GMT_module``. Note that if
your list of text arguments were obtained from a C ``main()`` function
then ``argv[0]`` will contain the name of the calling program. To avoid
passing this as a file name option, call ``GMT_Create_Options`` with
``argc-1`` and ``argv+1``. If you wish to pass a single text string with
multiple options (in lieu of an array of text strings), then pass
``argc`` = 0. When no longer needed you can remove the entire list by calling

.. _GMT_Destroy_Options:

  ::

    int GMT_Destroy_Options (void *API, struct GMT_OPTION **list);

The function returns TRUE (1) if there is an error (which is passed back
with ``API->error``), otherwise it returns FALSE (0).

The inverse function prototype is

.. _GMT_Create_Args:

  ::

    char **GMT_Create_Args (void *API, int *argc, struct GMT_OPTIONS *list);

which allocates space for the text strings and performs the conversion;
it passes back the count of the arguments via ``argc`` and returns a
pointer to the text array. In the case of an error we return a NULL
pointer and set ``API->error`` to reflect the error type. Note that
``argv[0]`` will not contain the name of the program as is the case the
arguments presented by a C ``main()`` function. When you no longer have
any use for the text array, call

.. _GMT_Destroy_Args:

  ::

    int GMT_Destroy_Args (void *API, int argc, char **argv[]);

to deallocate the space used. This function returns TRUE (1) if there is
an error (which is passed back with ``API->error``), otherwise it
returns FALSE (0).

Finally, to convert the linked list of option structures to a single
text string command, use

.. _GMT_Create_Cmd:

  ::

    char *GMT_Create_Cmd (void *API, struct GMT_OPTION *list);

Developers who plan to import and export *GMT* shell scripts might find
it convenient to use these functions. In case of an error we return a
NULL pointer and set ``API->error``, otherwise a pointer to an allocated
string is returned.  When you no longer have
any use for the text string, call

.. _GMT_Destroy_Cmd:

  ::

    int _GMT_Destroy_Cmd (void *API, char **argv);

to deallocate the space used. This function returns TRUE (1) if there is
an error (which is passed back with ``API->error``), otherwise it
returns FALSE (0).

Manage the linked list of options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several additional utility functions are available for programmers who
wish to manipulate program option structures within their own programs.
These allow you to create new option structures, append them to the
linked list, replace existing options with new values, find a particular
option, and remove options from the list. Note: The order in which the
options appear in the linked list is of no consequence to *GMT*.
Internally, *GMT* will sort and process the options in the manner
required. Externally, you are free to maintain your own order.

Make a new option structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``GMT_Make_Option`` will allocate a new option structure, assign it
values given the ``option`` and ``arg`` parameter (pass NULL if there is
no argument for this option), and returns a pointer to the allocated
structure. The prototype is

.. _GMT_Make_Option:

  ::

    struct GMT_OPTION *GMT_Make_Option (void *API, char option, char *arg);

Should memory allocation fail the function will print an error message
set an error code via ``API->error``, and return NULL.

Append an option to the linked list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


``GMT_Append_Option`` will append the specified ``option`` to the end of
the doubly-linked ``list``. The prototype is

.. _GMT_Append_Option:

  ::

    struct GMT_OPTION *GMT_Append_Option (void *API, struct GMT_OPTION *option, \
                                          struct GMT_OPTION *list);

We return the list back, and if ``list`` is given as NULL we return
``option`` as the start of the new list. Any errors results in a NULL
pointer with ``API->error`` holding the error type.

Find an option in the linked list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``GMT_Find_Option`` will return a pointer ``ptr`` to the first option in
the linked list starting at ``list`` whose option character equals
``option``. If not found we return NULL. While this is not necessarily
an error we still set ``API->error`` accordingly. The prototype is

.. _GMT_Find_Option:

  ::

    struct GMT_OPTION *GMT_Find_Option (void *API, char option,
                                        struct GMT_OPTION *list);

If you need to look for multiple occurrences of a certain option you
will need to call ``GMT_Find_Option`` again, passing the option
following the previously found option as the ``list`` entry, i.e.,

  ::

    list = *ptr->next;

Update an existing option in the list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``GMT_Update_Option`` will replace the argument of ``current`` with the
new argument ``arg`` and otherwise leave the option at its place in the
list. The prototype is

.. _GMT_Update_Option:

  ::

    int GMT_Update_Option (void *API, struct GMT_OPTION *current, char *arg);

An error will be reported if (a) ``current`` is NULL or (b) ``arg`` is
NULL. The function returns TRUE (1) if there is an error, otherwise it returns FALSE (0).

Delete an existing option in the linked list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may use ``GMT_Delete_Option`` to remove ``option`` from the linked
``list``. The prototype is

.. _GMT_Delete_Option:

  ::

    int GMT_Delete_Option (void *API, struct GMT_OPTION *current);

We return TRUE if the option is not found in the list and set
``API->error`` accordingly. Note: Only the first occurrence of the
specified option will be deleted. If you need to delete all such options
you will need to call this function in a loop until it returns a
non-zero status.

Specify a file via an linked option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To specify an input file name via an option, simply use < as the
option (this is what ``GMT_Create_Options`` does when it finds filenames
on the command line). Likewise, > can be used to explicitly
indicate an output file. In order to append to an existing file, use
>>. For example the following command would read from file.A and
append to file.B:

  ::

    gmtconvert -<file.A ->>file.B

These options also work on the command line but usually one would have
to escape the special characters < and > as they are
used for file redirection.

Calling a GMT module
--------------------

Given your linked list of program options (or text array) and possibly
some registered resources, you can now call the required *GMT* module
using one of the two flavors discussed in section [sec:func]. All
modules return an error or status code that your program should consider
before processing the results.

Adjusting headers and comments
------------------------------

All header records in incoming datasets are stored in memory. You may
wish to replace these records with new information, or append new
information to the existing headers. This is achieved with

.. _GMT_Set_Comment:

  ::

    int GMT_Set_Comment (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int mode
                         void *arg, void *data)

Again, ``family`` selects which kind of resource is passed via ``data``.
The ``mode`` determines what kind of comment is being considered, how it
should be included, and in what form the comment passed via ``arg`` is.
Table [tbl:comments] lists the available options, which may be combined
by adding (bitwise “or”). The ``GMT_Set_Comment`` does not actually
output anything but sets the relevant comment and header records in the
relevant structure. When a file is written out the information will be
output as well (Note: Users can always decide if they wish to turn
header output on or off via the common *GMT* option ``-h``. For
record-by-record writing you must enable the header block output when
you call GMT_Begin_IO_

.. _tbl-comments:

+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| constant                  | value | description                                          |
+===========================+=======+======================================================+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_TEXT       | 0     | Comment is a text string                             |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_OPTION     | 1     | Comment is a linked list of GMT_OPTION structures    |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_COMMAND    | 2     | Comment is the command                               |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_REMARK     | 4     | Comment is the remark                                |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_TITLE      | 4     | Comment is the title                                 |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_NAME_X     | 4     | Comment is the x variable name (grids only)          |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_NAME_Y     | 4     | Comment is the y variable name (grids only)          |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_NAME_Z     | 4     | Comment is the z variable name (grids only)          |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_COLNAMES   | 4     | Comment is the column names header                   |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GMT_COMMENT_IS_RESET      | 8     | Comment replaces existing information                |
+---------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------------+


The named modes (*command*, *remark*, *title*, *name_x,y,z* and
*colnames* are used to distinguish regular text comments from specific
fields in the header structures of the data resources, such as
``GMT_GRID``. For the various table resources (e.g., ``GMT_DATASET``)
these modifiers result in a specially formatted comments beginning with
"Command: " or "Remark: ", reflecting how this type of information is
encoded in the headers.

Exporting Data
--------------

If your program needs to write any of the four recognized data types
(CPT files, data tables, text tables, or *GMT* grids) you can use the
``GMT_Put_Data``. In the case of data and text tables, you may also
consider the ``GMT_Put_Record`` function. As a general rule, your
program organization may simplify if you can write the export the entire
resource with ``GMT_Put_Data``. However, if the program logic is simple
or already involves using ``GMT_Get_Record``, it may be better to export
one data record at the time via ``GMT_Put_Record``.

Both of these output functions takes a parameter called ``mode``. The
``mode`` parameter generally takes on different meanings for the
different data types and will be discussed below. However, one bit
setting is common to all types: By default, you are only allowed to
write a data resource once; the resource is then flagged to have been
written and subsequent attempts to write to the same resource will
quietly be ignored. In the unlikely event you need to re-write a
resource you can override this default behavior by adding GMT_IO_RESET
to your ``mode`` parameter.

Enable Data Export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to the data import procedures, once all output destinations have
been registered, we signal the API that we are done with the
registration phase and are ready to start the actual data export. As for
input, this step is only needed when dealing with record-by-record
writing. Again, we enable record-by-record writing by calling
``GMT_Begin_IO``, this time with ``direction`` = GMT_OUT. This function
enables data export and prepares the registered destinations for the
upcoming writing.

Exporting a data set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have your program accept results from *GMT* modules and write them
separately requires you to use the ``GMT_Write_Data`` or
``GMT_Put_Data`` functions. They are very similar to the
``GMT_Read_Data`` and ``GMT_Get_Data`` functions encountered earlier.

Exporting a data set to a file, stream, or handle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The prototype for writing to a file (via name, stream, or file handle) is

.. _GMT_Write_Data:

  ::

    int GMT_Write_Data (void *API, unsigned int family, unsigned int method,
                        unsigned int geometry, unsigned int mode,
                        double wesn[], void *output, void *data);

where ``data`` is a pointer to any of the four structures discussed
previously. Again, the ``mode`` parameter is specific to each data type:

**CPT table**
    ``mode`` controls if the CPT table's back-, fore-, and NaN-colors
    should be written (1) or not (0).

**Data table**
    If ``method`` is GMT_IS_FILE, then the value of ``mode`` affects
    how the data set is written:

    **GMT_WRITE_SET**
        The entire data set will be written to the single file [0].

    **GMT_WRITE_TABLE**
        Each table in the data set is written to individual files [1].
        You can either specify an output file name that *must* contain
        one C-style format specifier for a int variable (e.g.,
        "New_Table_%06d.txt"), which will be replaced with the table
        number (a running number from 0) *or* you must assign to each
        table *i* a unique output file name via the
        ``D->table[i]->file[GMT_OUT]`` variables prior to calling the
        function.

    **GMT_WRITE_SEGMENT**
        Each segment in the data set is written to an individual file
        [2]. Same setup as for GMT_WRITE_TABLE except we use
        sequential segment numbers to build the file names.

    **GMT_WRITE_TABLE_SEGMENT**
        Each segment in the data set is written to an individual file
        [3]. You can either specify an output file name that *must*
        contain two C-style format specifiers for two int variables
        (e.g., "New_Table_%06d_Segment_%03d.txt"), which will be
        replaced with the table and segment numbers, *or* you must
        assign to each segment *j* in each table *i* a unique output
        file name via the ``D->table[i]->segment[j]->file[GMT_OUT]``
        variables prior to calling the function.

    **GMT_WRITE_OGR**
        Writes the dataset in OGR/GMT format in conjunction with the
        ``-a`` setting [4].

**Text table**
    The ``mode`` is used the same way as for data tables.

**GMT grid**
    Here, ``mode`` may be GMT_GRID_HEADER_ONLY to only update a
    file's header structure, but normally it is simply GMT_GRID_ALL
    (0) so the entire grid and its header will be exported (a subset is
    not allowed during export). However, in the event your data array
    holds both the real and imaginary parts of a complex data set you
    must add either GMT_GRID_IS_COMPLEX_REAL (4) or
    GMT_GRID_IS_COMPLEX_IMAG (16) to ``mode`` so as to export the
    corresponding grid values correctly. Finally, for native binary
    grids you may skip writing the grid header by adding
    GMT_GRID_NO_HEADER (16); this setting is ignored for other grid
    formats. If your output grid is huge and you are building it
    row-by-row, set ``mode`` to GMT_GRID_HEADER_ONLY \|
    GMT_GRID_ROW_BY_ROW. You can then write the grid row-by-row
    using ``GMT_Put_Row``. By default the rows will be automatically
    processed in order. To completely specify which row to be written,
    use GMT_GRID_ROW_BY_ROW_MANUAL instead.

If successful the function returns FALSE (0); otherwise we return TRUE
(1) and set ``API->error`` to reflect to cause.  Note: If ``method`` is
GMT_IS_FILE, ``family`` is GMT_IS_GRID, and the filename implies a change
from NaN to another value then the grid is modified accordingly.  If you
continue to use that grid after writing please be aware that the changes
you specified were applied to the grid.

Exporting a data set to memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If writing to a memory destination you will want to first register that
destination and then use the returned ID with ``GMT_Put_Data`` instead:

.. _GMT_Put_Data:

  ::

    int GMT_Put_Data (void *API, int ID, unsigned int mode, void *data);

where ``ID`` is the unique ID of the registered destination, ``mode`` is
specific to each data type (and controls aspects of the output
structuring), and ``data`` is a pointer to any of the four structures
discussed previously. For more detail, see ``GMT_Write_Data`` above. If
successful the function returns FALSE (0); otherwise we return TRUE (1)
and set ``API->error`` to reflect to cause.

Exporting a data record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your program must write data table records one-by-one you must first
enable record-by-record writing with ``GMT_Begin_IO`` and then use the
``GMT_Put_Record`` function in a loop; the prototype is

.. _GMT_Put_Record:

  ::

    int GMT_Put_Record (void *API, unsigned int mode, void *rec);

where ``rec`` is a pointer to either (a) a double-precision array with
the current row. Then, ``rec`` is expected to hold at least as many
items as the current setting of ``n_col[GMT_OUT]``, which represents the
number of columns in the output destination. Alternatively (b), ``rec``
points to a text string. The ``mode`` parameter must be set to reflect
what is passed. Using ``GMT_Put_Record`` requires you to first
initialize the destination with ``GMT_Init_IO``. Note that for families
GMT_IS_DATASET and GMT_IS_TEXTSET the methods GMT_IS_DUPLICATE and
GMT_IS_REFERENCE are not supported since you can simply populate the
GMT_DATASET structure directly. As mentioned, ``mode`` affects what is
actually written:

**GMT_WRITE_DOUBLE**
    Normal operation that builds the current output record from the values in ``rec`` [0].

**GMT_WRITE_TEXT**
    For ASCII output mode we write the text string ``rec``. If ``rec``
    is NULL then we use the current (last imported) text record. If
    binary output mode we quietly skip writing this record [1].

**GMT_WRITE_TABLE_HEADER**
    For ASCII output mode we write the text string ``rec``. If ``rec``
    is NULL then we write the last read header record (and ensures it
    starts with #). If binary output mode we quietly skip writing this record [2].

**GMT_WRITE_SEGMENT_HEADER**
    For ASCII output mode we use the text string ``rec`` as the
    segment header. If ``rec`` is NULL then we use the current (last
    read) segment header record. If binary output mode instead we write
    a record composed of NaNs [1].

The function returns TRUE (1) if there was an error associated with the
writing (which is passed back with ``API->error``), otherwise it returns
FALSE (0).

Exporting a grid row
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your program must write a grid file row-by-row you must first enable
row-by-row writing with ``GMT_Read_Data`` and then use the
``GMT_Put_Row`` function in a loop; the prototype is

.. _GMT_Put_Row:

  ::

    int GMT_Put_Row (void *API, int row_no, struct GMT_GRID *G, float *row);

where ``row`` is a pointer to a single-precision array with the current
row, ``G`` is the grid in question, and ``row_no`` is the number of the
current row to be written. Note this value is only considered if the
row-by-row mode was initialized with GMT_GRID_ROW_BY_ROW_MANUAL.

Disable Data Export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the record-by-record output has completed we disable further output
to prevent accidental writing from occurring (due to poor program
structure, bugs, etc.). We do so by calling ``GMT_End_IO``. This
function disables further record-by-record data export; here, we
obviously pass ``direction`` as GMT_OUT.

Destroy allocated resources
---------------------------

If your session imported any data sets into memory then you may
explicitly free this memory once it is no longer needed and before
terminating the session. This is done with the ``GMT_Destroy_Data``
function, whose prototype is

.. _GMT_Destroy_Data:

  ::

    int GMT_Destroy_Data (void *API, void *data);

where ``data`` is the address of the pointer to a data container.  Note that
when each module completes it will automatically free memory created by
the API; similarly, when the session is destroyed we also automatically
free up memory. Thus, ``GMT_Destroy_Data`` is therefore generally only
needed when you wish to directly free up memory to avoid running out of
it. The function returns TRUE (1) if there is an error when trying to
free the memory (the error code is passed back with ``API->error``),
otherwise it returns FALSE (0).

Terminate a GMT session
-----------------------

Before your program exits it should properly terminate the
*GMT* session, which involves a call to

.. _GMT_Destroy_Session:

  ::

    int GMT_Destroy_Session (void *API);

which simply takes the pointer to the *GMT* API control structure as its
only arguments. It terminates the *GMT* machinery and deallocates all
memory used by the *GMT* API book-keeping. It also unregisters any
remaining resources previously registered with the session. The
*GMT* API will only close files that it was responsible for opening in
the first place. Finally, the API structure itself is freed so your main
program does not need to do so. The function returns TRUE (1) if there
is an error when trying to free the memory (the error code is passed
back with ``API->error``), otherwise it returns FALSE (0).

The GMT FFT Interface
=====================

While the i/o options presented so far lets you easily read in a data
table or grid and manipulated them, if you need to do so in the
wavenumber domain then this chapter is for you. Here we outline how to
take the Fourier transform of such data, perform calculations in the
wavenumber domain, and take the inverse transform before writing the
results. To assist programmers we also distribute fully functioning
demonstration programs that takes you through the steps we are about to
discuss; these demo programs may be used as your starting point for
further development.

Presenting and Parsing the FFT options
--------------------------------------

Several *GMT* programs using FFTs present the same unified option and
modifier sets to the user. The API makes these available as well. If
your program needs to present the option usage you can call

.. _GMT_FFT_Option:

  ::

    unsigned int GMT_FFT_Option (void *API, char option, unsigned int dim,
                                 char *string);

Here, ``option`` is the unique character used for this particular
program option (most *GMT* programs have standardized on using 'N' but
you are free to choose whatever you want except existing *GMT* common
options). The ``dim`` sets the dimension of the transform, currently you
must choose 1 or 2, while the ``string`` is a one-line message that
states what the option does; you should tailor this to your program. If
NULL then a generic message is placed instead.

To parse the user's selection you call

.. _GMT_FFT_Parse:

  ::

    void *GMT_FFT_Parse (void *API, char option, unsigned int dim, char *args);

which accepts the user's string option via ``args``; the other arguments
are the same as those above. The function returns an opaque pointer to a
structure with the chosen parameters.

Initializing the FFT machinery
------------------------------

Before your can take any transforms you must initialize the FFT
machinery. This process involves a series of preparatory steps that are
conveniently performed for you by

.. _GMT_FFT_Create:

  ::

    void *GMT_FFT_Create (void *API, void *X, unsigned int dim,
                          unsigned int mode, void *F);

Here, ``X`` is either your dataset or grid pointer, ``dim`` is the
dimension of the transform (1 or 2 only), ``mode`` passes various flags to the setup, such as whether
the data is real, imaginary, or complex, and ``F`` is the opaque pointer
returned by ``GMT_FFT_Parse``. Depending on the options you chose to
pass to ``GMT_FFT_Parse``, the data may have a constant or a trend
removed, reflected and extended by various symmetries, padded and
tapered to desired transform dimensions, and possibly there are
temporary files written out before the transform takes place. See the
man page for a full explanation of the options presented by
``GMT_FFT_Option``.

Taking the FFT
--------------

Now that everything has been set up you can perform the transform with

.. _GMT_FFT:

  ::

    void *GMT_FFT (void *API, void *X, int direction, unsigned int mode, void *K);

which takes as ``direction`` either GMT_FFT_FWD or GMT_FFT_INV. The
mode is used to specify if we pass a real (GMT_FFT_REAL) or complex
(GMT_FFT_COMPLEX) data set, and ``K`` is the opaque pointer returned
by ``GMT_FFT_Create``. The transform is performed in place and returned
via ``X``. When done with your manipulations (below) you can call it
again with the inverse flag to recover the corresponding space-domain
version of your data. The FFT is fully normalized so that calling
forward followed by inverse yields the original data set. The information
passed via ``K`` determines if a 1-D or 2-D transform takes place; the
key work is done via ``GMT_FFT_1D`` or ``GMT_FFT_1D`` below.

Taking the 1-D FFT
------------------

A lower-level 1-D FFT is also available via

.. _GMT_FFT_1D:

  ::

    int GMT_FFT_1D (void *API, float *data, uint64_t n, int direction, unsigned int mode);

which takes as ``direction`` either GMT_FFT_FWD or GMT_FFT_INV. The
mode is used to specify if we pass a real (GMT_FFT_REAL) or complex
(GMT_FFT_COMPLEX) data set, and ``data`` is the 1-D data array of length
``n`` that we wish
to transform. The transform is performed in place and returned
via ``data``. When done with your manipulations (below) you can call it
again with the inverse flag to recover the corresponding space-domain
version of your data. The 1-D FFT is fully normalized so that calling
forward followed by inverse yields the original data set.  Note that unlike
``GMT_FFT``, this functions does not do any data extension, mirroring, detrending,
etc. but operates directly on the data array given.

Taking the 2-D FFT
------------------

A lower-level 2-D FFT is also available via

.. _GMT_FFT_2D:

  ::

    int GMT_FFT_2D (void *API, float *data, unsigned int nx, unsigned int ny, int direction, unsigned int mode);

which takes as ``direction`` either GMT_FFT_FWD or GMT_FFT_INV. The
mode is used to specify if we pass a real (GMT_FFT_REAL) or complex
(GMT_FFT_COMPLEX) data set, and ``data`` is the 2-D data array in
row-major format, with row length ``nx`` and column length ``ny``.
The transform is performed in place and returned
via ``data``. When done with your manipulations (below) you can call it
again with the inverse flag to recover the corresponding space-domain
version of your data. The 2-D FFT is fully normalized so that calling
forward followed by inverse yields the original data set.  Note that unlike
``GMT_FFT``, this functions does not do any data extension, mirroring, detrending,
etc. but operates directly on the data array given.

Wavenumber calculations
-----------------------

As your data have been transformed to the wavenumber domain you may wish
to operate on the various values as a function of wavenumber. We will
show how this is done for datasets and grids separately. First, we
present the function that returns an individual wavenumber:

.. _GMT_FFT_Wavenumber:

  ::

    double GMT_FFT_Wavenumber (void *API, uint64_t k, unsigned int mode, void *K);

where ``k`` is the index into the array or grid, ``mode`` specifies
which wavenumber we want (it is not used for 1-D transform but for the
2-D transform we can select either the x-wavenumber (0), the
y-wavenumber (1), or the radial wavenumber (2)), and finally the opaque
vector used earlier.

1-D FFT manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be added later.

2-D FFT manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of complex pairs in the grid is given by the header's ``nm``
variable, while ``size`` will be twice that value as it holds the number
of components. To visit all the complex values and obtain the
corresponding wavenumber we simply need to loop over ``size`` and call
``GMT_FFT_Wavenumber``. This code snippet multiples the complex grid by
the radial wavenumber:

  ::

    uint64_t k;
    for (k = 0; k < Grid->header->size; k++) {
        wave = GMT_FFT_Wavenumber (API, k, 2, K);
        Grid->data[k] *= wave;
    }

Alternatively, you may choose to be more specific about which components
are real and imaginary (especially if they are to be treated
differently), and set up the loop this way:

  ::

    uint64_t re, im;
    for (re = 0, im = 1; re < Grid->header->size; re += 2, im += 2) {
        wave = GMT_FFT_Wavenumber (API, re, 2, K);
        Grid->data[re] *= wave;
        Grid->data[im] *= 2.0 * wave;
    }

Destroying the FFT machinery
----------------------------

When done you terminate the FFT machinery with

.. _GMT_FFT_Destroy:

  ::

    double GMT_FFT_Destroy (void *API, void *K);

which simply frees up the memory allocated by the FFT machinery.

FORTRAN interfaces
==================

FORTRAN 90 developers who wish to use the *GMT* API may use the same
API functions as discussed in Chapter 2. As we do not have much (i.e., any) experience
with modern Fortran we are not sure to what extent you are able to access
the members of the various structures, such as the GMT_GRID structure. Thus,
this part will depend on feedback and for the time being is to be considered
preliminary and subject to change.  We encourage you to take contact should you
wish to use the API with your Fortran 90 programs.

FORTRAN 77 Grid i/o
-------------------

Because of a lack of structure pointers we can only provide a low level of
support for Fortran 77. This API is limited to help you inquire, read and write
GMT grids directly from Fortran 77.
To inquire about the range of information in a grid, use

.. _GMT_F77_readgrdinfo:

  ::

    int GMT_F77_readgrdinfo (unsigned int dim[], double limits[], double inc[],
                             char *title, char *remark, char *file)

where ``dim`` returns the grid width, height, and registration, ``limits`` returns the min and max values for x, y, and z
as three consecutive pairs, ``inc`` returns the x and y increment, the ``title`` and ``remark`` returns the values of these strings.  The ``file``
argument is the name of the file we wish to inquire about.  The function returns 0 unless there is an error.
Note that you must declare your variables so that ``limits`` has at least 6 elements and ``inc`` and ``dime`` have at least 2 each.

To actually read the grid, we use

.. _GMT_F77_readgrd:

  ::

    int GMT_F77_readgrd (float *array, unsigned int dim[], double wesn[],
                         double inc[], char *title, char *remark, char *file)

where ``array`` is the 1-D grid data array, ``dim`` returns the grid width, height, and registration,
``limits`` returns the min and max values for x, y, and z, ``inc`` returns the x and y increments,
the ``title`` and ``remark`` returns the values of these strings.  The ``file``
argument is the name of the file we wish to read from.  The function returns 0 unless there is an error.
Note on input, ``dim[2]`` can be set to 1 which means we will allocate the array for you; otherwise
we assume space has already been secured.  Also, if ``dim[3]`` is set to 1 we will in-place transpose
the array from C-style row-major array order to Fortran column-major array order.

Finally, to write a grid to file you can use

.. _GMT_F77_writegrd:

  ::

    int GMT_F77_writegrd_(float *array, unsigned int dim[], double wesn[],
                          double inc[], char *title, char *remark, char *file)

where ``array`` is the 1-D grid data array, ``dim`` specifies the grid width, height, and registration,
``limits`` may be used to specify a subset (normally, just pass zeros), ``inc`` specifies the x and y increments,
the ``title`` and ``remark`` supplies the values of these strings.  The ``file``
argument is the name of the file we wish to write to.  The function returns 0 unless there is an error.
Note on input, ``dim[2]`` can be set to 1 which means we will allocate the array for you; otherwise
we assume space has already been secured.  Also, if ``dim[3]`` is set to 1 we will in-place transpose
the array from Fortran column-major array order to C-style row-major array order before writing. Note
this means array will have been transposed when the function returns.
