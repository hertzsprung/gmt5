#	Original GMT Guru Makefile Macro for Makefile.guru
#	Users should cp to gmtguru.macros and edit it instead!
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The Makefile.guru file for GMT can be used by any GMT
# Developer to do chores ranging from compiling and linking
# and running examples, to preparing new tar archives for release.
# Any developer may create a tar distribution locally with the
# Makefile.guru makefile for testing purposes.
#
# Below, set the VERSION to be created; tar archives are placed
# in GMT/ftp.  Also, you may want to change the DATE value.

VERSION		= GMT4.0
GMTBRANCH	= 4
CPFLAGS		= -I. -DDATE="\"1 Sept 2004\"" -DVERSION="\"$(VERSION)\""
FTPSITE		= gmt.soest.hawaii.edu	# Set this to the mirror site closest to you
AUTOCONF	= autoconf		# GNU autoconf utility (add path if not in your search path)
GMT_SHARED_LIBS	=# --enable-shared	# --enable-shared for shared; empty for static libraries
GMT_US		= --enable-US		# --enable-US for inch; empty for cm
GMT_TRIANGLE	= --enable-triangle	# --enable-triangle for Shewchuk's triangulation; empty for Watson's
GMT_DEBUG	= --enable-debug	# --enable-debug will use -g; else -O with compiler

# The following two will let you tailor where GMT will install (1) machine-specific executables/libraries and
# (2) machine-independent files such as the stuff in share, man pages etc.  By default they are all installed
# in the main GMT directory.  Uncomment these two to change this behavior:

GMT_DIST	= #--prefix=/usr/local/gmt 		# Uncomment for alternate installation path for machine-independent files (man, web)
GMT_EXDIST	= #--exec_prefix=/usr/local/gmt/linux	# Uncomment for alternate installation path for executables

#  Choose the correct preprocessing command for your system (this is for man page processing only):
#
TXT2MAN		= /usr/bin/cpp -w -P -nostdinc	# Linux
#TXT2MAN	= /usr/ccs/lbin/cpp		# HPUX
#TXT2MAN	= cc -E -Xs			# Solaris Workshop
