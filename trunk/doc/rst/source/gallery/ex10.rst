.. _example_10:

(10) A geographical bar graph plot
----------------------------------

Our next and perhaps most business-like example presents a
three-dimensional bar graph plot showing the geographic distribution of
the membership in the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The input data
was taken from the January 2008 AGU member directory and added up to
give total members per continent. We decide to plot a 3-D column
centered on each continent with a height that is proportional to the
logarithm of the membership. A log\ :math:`_{10}`-scale is used since
the memberships vary by almost 3 orders of magnitude. We choose a plain
linear projection for the basemap and add the columns and text on top.
Our script that produces Figure ex_10 reads:
