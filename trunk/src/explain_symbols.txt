OPT(S)[IT(symbol)][IT(size)|BD(+s)IT(scaling)]
Plot symbols.  If present, IT(size) is symbol size in the unit set in BD(gmt.conf)
(unless BD(c), BD(i), or BD(p) is appended).
If the symbol code (see below) is not given it will be read from the last column in the input data;
this cannot be used in conjunction with GMT_bi_OPT.  Optionally, append
BD(c), BD(i), or BD(p) to indicate that the size information in the
input data is in units of cm, inch, or point, respectively [Default is BD(PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT)].
Note: if you give both size and symbol via the input file you must use BD(PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT) to
indicate the units used for the symbol size.  If the symbol size is expected via the
#ifdef THREE_D
fourth
#else
third
#endif
data column
then you may convert those values to symbol sizes by appending BD(+s)IT(scale)[/IT(origin)][BD(l)]
which will compute size = (data - IT(origin)) * IT(scale), where IT(origin) defaults to 0.  If BD(l)
is appended we take log10 of data and IT(origin) first [IT(origin) then defaults to 1].
.br
The uppercase symbols BD(A), BD(C), BD(D), BD(G), BD(H), BD(I), BD(N), BD(S), BD(T)
are normalized to have the same area as a circle with diameter IT(size),
while the size of the corresponding lowercase symbols refers to the diameter of a circumscribed circle.
.br
Choose between these symbol codes:
.TP
OPT(S-)
x-dash (-).  IT(size) is the length of a short horizontal (x-dir) line segment.
.TP
OPT(S+)
plus (+).  IT(size) is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sa)
st\fBa\fPr.  IT(size) is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sb)
Vertical BD(b)ar extending from IT(base) to y.  IT(size) is bar width. Append BD(u)
if IT(size) is in x-units [Default is plot-distance units]. By default,
IT(base) = ymin.  Append BD(b)IT(base) to change this value.
.TP
OPT(SB)
Horizontal BD(b)ar extending from IT(base) to x.  IT(size) is bar width. Append BD(u)
if IT(size) is in y-units [Default is plot-distance units]. By default,
IT(base) = xmin.  Append BD(b)IT(base) to change this value.
.TP
OPT(Sc)
BD(c)ircle.  IT(size) is diameter of circle.
.TP
OPT(Sd)
BD(d)iamond.  IT(size) is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Se)
BD(e)llipse.  Direction (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), major_axis, and minor_axis must be found in columns
#ifdef THREE_D
4, 5, and 6.
#else
3, 4, and 5.
#endif
.TP
OPT(SE)
Same as OPT(Se), except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (OPT(Se) leaves the directions
unchanged.)  Furthermore, the axes lengths must be given in km instead of plot-distance units.  An exception occurs for
a linear projection in which we assume the ellipse axes are given in the same units as OPT(R).
.TP
OPT(Sf)
BD(f)ront.  OPT(Sf)IT(gap/size)[BD(+l)|BD(+r)][BD(+b+c+f+s+t)][BD(+o)IT(offset)].  Supply distance gap between symbols and symbol size.
If IT(gap) is negative, it is interpreted to mean the number of symbols along the front instead.  Append BD(+l) or BD+r) to plot symbols
on the left or right side of the front [Default is centered].  Append BD(+)IT(type) to specify which symbol
to plot: BD(b)ox, BD(c)ircle, BD(f)ault, BD(s)lip, or BD(t)riangle.  [Default is BD(f)ault].
Slip means left-lateral or right-lateral strike-slip arrows (centered is not an option).  Append BD(+o)IT(offset) to offset
the first symbol from the beginning of the front by that amount [0].
.TP
OPT(Sg)
octaBD(g)on.  IT(size) is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sh)
BD(h)exagon.  IT(size) is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Si)
BD(i)nverted triangle.  IT(size) is diameter of circumscribing circle.
.TP
OPT(Sj)
Rotated rectangle.  Direction (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), x-dimension, and y-dimension must be found in columns
#ifdef THREE_D
4, 5, and 6.
#else
3, 4, and 5.
#endif
.TP
OPT(SJ)
Same as OPT(Sj), except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (OPT(Sj) leaves the directions
unchanged.)  Furthermore, the dimensions must be given in km instead of plot-distance units.  An exception occurs for
a linear projection in which we assume the dimensions are given in the same units as OPT(R).
.TP
OPT(Sk)
BD(k)ustom symbol.  Append <name>/IT(size), and we will look for a definition file called
<name>.def in (1) the current directory or (2) in ~/.gmt or (3) in BD($GMT_SHAREDIR)/custom.  The symbol as defined
in that file is of size 1.0 by default; the appended IT(size) will scale symbol accordingly.
#ifdef THREE_D
The symbols are plotted in the IT(x-y) plane.
#endif
Users may add their own custom *.def files; see CUSTOM SYMBOLS below.
.TP
OPT(Sl)
BD(l)etter or text string (less than 64 characters).  Give size, and append /IT(string) after the size.
Note that the size is only approximate; no individual scaling
is done for different characters.  Remember to escape special characters like *.  Optionally, you may append %IT(font)
to select a particular font [Default is BD(FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY)].
.TP
OPT(Sm)
BD(m)ath angle arc, optionally with one or two arrow heads [Default is no arrow heads].
The IT(size) is the length of the vector head.  Arc width is set by OPT(W).
The radius of the arc and its start and stop directions (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal)
must be given in columns
#ifdef THREE_D
4-6.
#else
3-5.
#endif
See VECTOR ATTRIBUTES for specifying attributes.
.TP
OPT(SM)
Same as OPT(Sm) but switches to straight angle symbol if angles subtend 90 degrees exactly.
.TP
OPT(Sn)
peBD(n)tagon.  IT(size) is diameter of circumscribing circle.
#ifdef THREE_D
.TP
OPT(So)
cBD(o)lumn (3-D) extending from IT(base) to z.  IT(size) sets base width (Use IT(xsize/ysize) if not the same).  Append BD(u) if IT(size) is in x-units
[Default is plot-distance units].  If no IT(size) is given we expect both IT(xsize) and IT(ysize) as two extra data columns.
By default, IT(base) = 0.  Append bIT(base) to change this value.  The facet colors will be modified to simulate shading.
Use OPT(SO) to disable such 3-D illumination.
#endif
.TP
OPT(Sp)
BD(p)oint.  No size needs to be specified (1 pixel is used).

made up of any of the following control arguments:
