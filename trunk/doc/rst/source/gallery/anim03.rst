.. _anim_03:

(3) Orbiting a static map
-------------------------

Our third animation keeps a fixed gridded data set but moves the camera
angle around the full 360. We use
`grdview <grdview.html>`_ to generate a shaded-relief
image sequence using the new enhanced **-E** option. No additional
information is plotted on the image. As before we produce an animated
GIF image and a simple HTML wrapper for it.
