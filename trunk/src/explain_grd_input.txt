.SH GRID FILE FORMATS
\fBGMT\fP is able to recognize many of the commonly used grid file formats, as well as the precision, scale and offset of the values
contained in the grid file. When \fBGMT\fP needs a little help with that, you can add the suffix GMT_GRD_SUFFIX,
where \fIid\fP is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and precision, and \fIscale\fP and \fIoffset\fP are optional scale factor
and offset to be applied to all grid values, and \fInan\fP is the value used to indicate missing data.
See \fBgrdreformat\fP(1) and Section 4.17 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information.
.P
When reading a netCDF file that contains multiple grids, \fBGMT\fP will read, by default, the first 2-dimensional grid that can find in that
file. To coax \fBGMT\fP into reading another multi-dimensional variable in the grid file, append \fB?\fP\fIvarname\fP to the file name, where
\fIvarname\fP is the name of the variable. Note that you may need to escape the special meaning of \fB?\fP in your shell program
by putting a backslash in front of it, or by placing the filename and suffix between quotes or double quotes.
See \fBgrdreformat\fP(1) and Section 4.18 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information,
particularly on how to read splices of 3-, 4-, or 5-dimensional grids.
