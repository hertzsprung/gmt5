Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.5.1.
This release fixes a few problems (mostly 64-bit related),
but also adds some new functionality, such as the polyconic
projection and experimental GDAL file import.  Finally, we
provide a minor revision to the netcdf GSHHS files (2.0.1)
needed to support the new pscoast -A options.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

As of this notice, all but the Japan and S Africa mirror
ftp servers are now synced up; we hope those two will follow
within 24 hours.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
