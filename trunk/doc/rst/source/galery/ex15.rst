(15) Gridding, contouring, and masking of unconstrained areas
-------------------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates some off the
different ways one can use to grid data in *GMT*, and how to deal with
unconstrained areas. We first convert a large ASCII file to binary with
`gmtconvert <gmtconvert.html>`_ since the binary file
will read and process much faster. Our lower left plot illustrates the
results of gridding using a nearest neighbor technique
(`nearneighbor <../nearneighbor.html>`_) which is a local
method: No output is given where there are no data. Next (lower right),
we use a minimum curvature technique
(`surface <../surface.html>`_) which is a global method.
Hence, the contours cover the entire map although the data are only
available for portions of the area (indicated by the gray areas plotted
using `psmask <../psmask.html>`_). The top left scenario
illustrates how we can create a clip path (using
`psmask <../psmask.html>`_) based on the data coverage to
eliminate contours outside the constrained area. Finally (top right) we
simply employ `pscoast <../pscoast.html>`_ to overlay gray
land masses to cover up the unwanted contours, and end by plotting a
star at the deepest point on the map with
`psxy <../psxy.html>`_. This point was extracted from the
grid files using `grdinfo <../grdinfo.html>`_.
