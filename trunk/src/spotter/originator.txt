.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoriginator\fP reads (longitude, latitude, height, radius, crustal_age) records from \fIinfiles\fP 
[or standard input] and uses the given Absolute Plate Motion (APM) stage
poles and the list of hotspot locations to determine the most likely origin (hotspot)
for each seamount.  It does so by calculating flowlines back in time and determining
the closest approach to all hotspots.  The output consists of the input records with
four additional fields added for each of the \fIn_hs\fP closest hotspots.  The four fields
are the hotspot id (e.g., HWI), the stage id of the flowline segment that came closest,
the pseudo-age of the seamount, and the closest distance to the hotspot (in km).
See option \fB\-:\fP on how to read (latitude, longitude,height, radius, crustal_ag) files.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIinfile(s)\fP
Seamount data file(s) to be analyzed.  If not given, standard input is read.
.TP
.B \-E
Give file with stage poles and opening angles.  This file must contain
one record for each stage; each record must be of the following format:
.br
.sp
	lon lat tstart tstop ccw-angle
.br
.sp
where time is in Ma and the rest is in degrees.  Oldest stage must be
listed first.  tstart is the time when the stage begins (oldest age).
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-F
Give file with hotspot locations.  This file must contain
one record for each hotspot to be considered; each record must be of the
following format:
.br
.sp
	lon lat hs_id hs_name
.br
.sp
E.g., for Hawaii this may look like
.br
.sp
205	20	HWI	Hawaii
.br
.sp
Blank lines and records whose first column contains # will be ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-C
Expect Total Reconstruction Poles (Finite Poles) rather than Backward Stage Poles [Default]
File format is similar to the stage pole format except the youngest rotation must be listed
first and that the tstart column is optional (assumed to be 0 Ma).
.TP
.B \-D
Sets the flowline sampling interval in km.  [5].
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-N
Set the maximum age to extend the oldest stage back in time [no extension].
.TP
.B \-S
Set the number of closest hotspots to report [1].
.TP
.B \-T
Truncate seamount ages exceeding the upper age set with -N [no truncation].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Only report those seamounts whose flowlines' closest approach to any hotspot
were less than \fImaxdist\fP [Default reports all seamounts].
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-i.txt"
#include "explain_-n.txt"
[Default is 5 input columns]
.SH EXAMPLES
To find the likely (hotspot) origins of the seamounts represented by the (x,y,z,r,tc) points
in the file seamounts.d, using the DC85.d Euler poles and the pac_hs.d list of possible hotspots,
and report the 2 most likely hotspot candidates for each seamount, run
