Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.5.4.
This stable release mostly fixes several bugs and is recommended
for all GMT users.  For a complete list of enhancements and
features, please see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference
& Cookbook or follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

As of today, all but the Japan, European (2), and S Africa mirror
ftp servers are now synced up; we hope those four will follow
within 24 hours.  Alternatively, OS X users will find GMT 4.5.4
in Fink's 'unstable' tree.

Concurrently we are making available, via cvs access, an alpha
version of GMT5, the next generation of GMT.  For more information
about GMT 5 and who should consider trying it out, please visit
gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/5.

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
