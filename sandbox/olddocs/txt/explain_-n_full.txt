GMT_n_OPT
Select grid interpolation mode by adding BD(b) for B-spline smoothing,
BD(c) for bicubic interpolation, BD(l) for bilinear interpolation, or
BD(n) for nearest-neighbor value (for example to plot categorical data).
Optionally, append BD(+a) to switch off antialiasing (where supported).
Append BD(+b)IT(BC) to override the boundary conditions used, adding
BD(g) for geographic, BD(p) for periodic, or BD(n) for natural boundary conditions.
For the latter two you may append BD(x) or BD(y) to specify just one direction,
otherwise both are assumed.
Add append BD(+t)IT(threshold) to control how close to nodes with NaNs the interpolation will go.
A IT(threshold) of 1.0 requires all (4 or 16) nodes involved in interpolation
to be non-NaN. 0.5 will interpolate about half way from a non-NaN value; 0.1 will go about 90% of the way, etc.
[Default is bicubic interpolation with antialiasing and a threshold of 0.5, using
geographic  (if grid is known to be geographic) or natural boundary conditions].
