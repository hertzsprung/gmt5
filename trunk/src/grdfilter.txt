.SH NAME
grdfilter \- Filter a 2-D grid file in the space (or time) domain
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(grdfilter) IT(input_file) OPT(D)IT(distance_flag) OPT(F)IT(<filtertype><width>)[IT(mode)] 
OPT(G)IT(output_file) [ GMT_I_OPT ] [ OPT(N)BD(i)|BD(p)|BD(r) ] [ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ OPT(T) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] [ GMT_f_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(grdfilter) will filter a IT(.nc) file in the time domain using one
of the selected convolution or non-convolution isotropic filters and
compute distances using Cartesian or Spherical geometries.
The output IT(.nc) file can optionally be generated as a
sub-region of the input (via OPT(R)) and/or with a new OPT(I)ncrement.  In this
way, one may have "extra space" in the input data so that the
edges will not be used and the output can be within one-half-
width of the input edges.  If the filter is low-pass, then the
output may be less frequently sampled than the input.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(input_file)
The grid file of points to be filtered.
(See GRID FILE FORMATS below).
.TP
OPT(D)IT(distance_flag)
Distance IT(flag) tells how grid (x,y) relates to filter IT(width) as follows:
.sp
IT(flag) = 0:  grid (x,y) same units as IT(width), Cartesian distances.
.br
IT(flag) = 1:  grid (x,y) in degrees, IT(width) in kilometers, Cartesian distances.
.br
IT(flag) = 2:  grid (x,y) in degrees, IT(width) in km, dx scaled by cos(middle y), Cartesian distances.
.sp
The above options are fastest because they allow weight matrix to be computed only once.
The next three options are slower because they recompute weights for each latitude.
.sp
IT(flag) = 3:  grid (x,y) in degrees, IT(width) in km, dx scaled by cosine(y), Cartesian distance calculation.
.br
IT(flag) = 4:  grid (x,y) in degrees, IT(width) in km, Spherical distance calculation.
.br
IT(flag) = 5:  grid (x,y) in Mercator OPT(Jm)1 img units, IT(width) in km, Spherical distance calculation.
.TP
OPT(F)IT(<filtertype><width>)[IT(mode)]
Sets the filter type.  Choose among convolution and non-convolution filters.  Use any
IT(filtertype) (listed below) followed by the full diameter IT(width).
.br
Convolution filters are:
.br
(BD(b)) Boxcar: All weights are equal.
.br
(BD(c)) Cosine Arch: Weights follow a cosine arch curve.
.br
(BD(g)) Gaussian: Weights are given by the Gaussian function, where IT(width) is 6 times the
conventional Gaussian sigma.
.br
Non-convolution filters are:
.br
(BD(m)) Median: Returns median value.
.br
(BD(p)) Maximum likelihood probability (a mode estimator): Return modal value.
If more than one mode is found we return their average value.  Append BD(-) or BD(+) to
the filter width if you rather want to return the smallest or largest of the modal
values.
.br
(BD(l)) Lower: Return the minimum of all values.
.br
(BD(L)) Lower: Return minimum of all positive values only.
.br
(BD(u)) Upper: Return maximum of all values.
.br
(BD(U)) Upper: Return maximum or all negative values only.
.br
In the case of BD(L)|BD(U) it is possible that no data passes the initial sign test; in that case
the filter will return 0.0.
.TP
OPT(G)IT(output_file)
IT(output_file) is the output grid file of the filter.
(See GRID FILE FORMATS below).
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
GMT_I_OPT
IT(x_inc) [and optionally IT(y_inc)] is the output Increment. Append BD(m) to indicate arc minutes, or BD(s) to indicate arc seconds.
If  the new IT(x_inc), IT(y_inc) are NOT integer multiples of the old ones (in the input data), filtering will be considerably slower.
[Default:  Same as input.]
.TP
OPT(N)BD(i)|BD(p)|BD(r)
Determine how NaN-values in the input grid affects the filtered outout:  Append BD(i) to ignore all NaNs in
the calculation of filtered value [Default], BD(r) is same as BD(i) except if the input node was NaN then the
output node will be set to NaN (only applies if both grids are coregistered), and BD(p) which will
force the filtered value to be NaN if any grid-nodes with NaN-values are found inside the filter circle.
.TP
OPT(R)
IT(west), IT(east), IT(south), and IT(north) defines the Region of the output points.  [Default:  Same as input.]
.TP
OPT(T)
Toggle the node registration for the output grid so as to become the opposite of the input grid
[Default gives the same registration as the input grid].

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose that north_pacific_dbdb5.nc is a file of 5 minute bathymetry from 140E to 260E and 0N to 50N, and you want to find
the medians of values within a 300km radius (600km full width) of the output points, which you choose to be from 150E to 250E
and 10N to 40N, and you want the output values every 0.5 degree.  Using spherical distance calculations, you need:
.sp
BD(grdfilter) north_pacific_dbdb5.nc OPT(G)filtered_pacific.nc OPT(Fm)600 OPT(D)4 OPT(R)150/250/10/40 OPT(I)0.5 OPT(V)
.SH LIMITATIONS
When working with geographic (lat, lon) grids, all three convolution filters (boxcar, cosine arch, and gaussian) will properly normalize
the filter weights for the variation in gridbox size with latitude, and correctly determine which nodes are needed for the convolution
when the filter "circle" crosses a periodic (0-360) boundary or contains a geographic pole.  However, the spatial filters, such as median and mode filters,
do not use weights and thus should only be used on Cartesian grids (or at very low latitudes) only.  If you want to apply such spatial
filters you should project your data to an equal-area projection and run grdfilter on the resulting Cartesian grid.
.br
To use the OPT(D)5 option the input Mercator grid must be created by img2mercgrd using the OPT(C) option so the origin of the
y-values is the Equator (i.e., x = y = 0 correspond to lon = lat = 0).
