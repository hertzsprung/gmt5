.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_cross\fP is used to determine all intersections between ("external cross-overs") or within
("internal cross-overs") tracks, and report the time, position, discrepancies in all observables, the
mean values of the observables, heading along each tracksegment, and the
distance along track at the cross-over point. The names of the files are passed
on the command line, or as a list of files with the \fB\-L\fP option.
By default, \fBx2sys_cross\fP will  look for both external and internal cross-overs.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-C
Select procedure for along-track distance calculation:
.br
	\fBc\fP Cartesian distances [Default].
.br
	\fBf\fP Flat Earth distances.
.br
	\fBg\fP Great circle distances.
.br
	\fBe\fP Geodesic distances on current GMT ellipsoid.
.TP
.B \-D
Give the definition file for this data format.
.TP
.B \-F
Sets which columns to use.  Give a comma-separated list of column names;
this list must include \fBx\fP, \fBy\fP or \fBlon\fP, \fBlat\fP and ideally
\fBtime\fP [Default selects all columns].
.TP
.B \-G
Selects geographical coordinates.  Append \fBd\fP for discontinuity at the
Dateline (makes longitude go from -180 to + 180) or \fBg\fP for discontinuity
at Greenwhich (makes longitude go from 0 to 360 [Default]).
.TP
.B \-I
Sets the interpolation mode. Choose among:
.br
	\fBl\fP Linear interpolation [Default].
.br
	\fBa\fP Akima spline interpolation.
.br
	\fBc\fP Cubic spline interpolation.
.br
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-K
Only process the pair-combinations found in the file \fIcombi.lis\fP
[Default process all possible combinations among the specified files].
.TP
.B \-L
Supply a list with track names (one per line).
#include "explain_-M.txt"
.TP
.B \-N
Append \fBd\fP for distance or \fBs\fP for speed, then give the desired \fIunit\fP as
\fBe\fP (meter or m/s), \fBk\fP (km or km/hr), \fBm\fP (miles and miles/hr), or
\fBn\fP (nautical miles and knots).  [Default is \fB\-Ndk \-Nse\fP (km and m/s)].
.TP
.B \-O
Output results using the old XOVER format [Default is X2SYS format].
This option should only be used with *.gmt-formatted MGD77 files.
.TP
.B \-Q
Append \fBe\fP for external crossovers only, and \fBi\fP for internal
crossovers only [Default is all crossovers].
#include "explain_-R.txt"
.TP
.B \-S
Defines window of track speed within which to calculate crossovers.
.br
	\fB\-Sl\fP sets lower speed [Default is 0].
.br
	\fB\-Su\fP sets upper speed [Default is Infinity].
.br
.TP
.B \-T
Sets the data set \fITAG\fP which, among other things, sets the definition file.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Give \fBt\fP, \fBd\fP, or \fBn\fP and append the corresponding
maximum time gap [Infinity], or distance gap [Infinity] (both in user units) allowed between
the two points immediately on either side of a crossover.  If the gap exceeds this maximum
gap we skip the crossover calculation.  For \fB\-Wn\fP, give the maximum number of points on
either side to use in the interpolation [3].
.TP
.B \-2
Report the values of each track at the crossover [Default is the crossover value and the mean value].
#include "explain_-o_binary.txt"
.SH REMARKS
The COEs found are printed out to standard output in ASCII format (unless
\fB\-bo\fP is set).  When ASCII is chosen, the output format depends on
whether or not old-style XOVER output (\fB\-O\fP) has been selected.
If so, then the first record contains the file names and their start year,
whereas subsequent records have the data for each COE encountered.  The fields
written out are lat, lon, time along track #1 and track #2,
x_gravity, x_magnetics, x_bathymetry, average gravity, average magnetics,
average bathymetry, heading along track #1 and track #2. If
the default format is chosen then the header record starts with "> ", and
the output format for crossovers are first 10 columns that contain
x, y, time along track #1 and track #2, distance along track #1 and track #2,
heading along track #1 and track #2, velocity along track #1 and #2, and
then pairs of (COE, average value) for each data type.  Sign convention:
If lega and legb are passed on the command line, then the COE value is Value
(lega) - Value (legb).  It is recommended that the Akima spline is used
instead of the natural cubic spline, since it is less sensitive to outliers
that tend to introduce wild oscillations in the interpolation.
.SH EXAMPLES
To compute all internal crossovers in the gmt-formatted file c2104.gmt, and
output in the old XOVER format, use
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_cross\fP c2104.gmt \fB\-O \-D\fPgmt > c2104.d
.br
.sp
To find the crossover locations with bathymetry between the two MGD77
files A13232.mgd77 and A99938.mgd77, try
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_cross\fP A13232.mgd77 A99938.mgd77 \fB\-Qe \-D\fPmgd77 \fB\-F\fPlon,lat,depth > crossovers.d
