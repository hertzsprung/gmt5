Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.1.3
For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).  This release mostly fixes
bugs and shortcomings in GMT 4.1.2 and is the last release
before the summer.

At this point, the US mirrors have synced up, and we expect
the others to follow within 24 hours.  Note the Australia
mirror is down and will hopefully be replaced later this year.


Sincerely,

Paul Wessel
Walter H. F. Smith
The GMT Team
