GMT is released under the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</A>
</CENTER>

<P>Note: current version is GMT-3.4. Also see the <A HREF="gmt/gmt_bugs.html">ERRATA </A> page.

<P>Version 3.4 was officially announced on April 18, 2001.  Click
<A HREF="gmt/gmt_releases.html">here</A> to
read the release announcements.

<P>GMT is a free, open source collection of ~60 UNIX tools that allow
users to manipulate (x,y) and (x,y,z) data sets (including filtering, trend
fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and produce Encapsulated PostScript
File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots through contour
maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views in
black and white, gray tone, hachure patterns, and 24-bit color. GMT supports
25 common map projections plus linear, log, and power scaling, and comes
with support data such as coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.

<P>GMT is developed and maintained by <A HREF="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/wessel.html">Paul
Wessel</A> and <A HREF="http://ibis.grdl.noaa.gov/SAT/people/walter.html">Walter H. F.

GMT is partly supported by the <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</A>.

Cannot find the answer to a question in the documentation?</H2>
We have a world-wide mailinglist for use by GMT users. If you send mail
to <A HREF="mailto:gmthelp@soest.hawaii.edu">gmthelp</A> it will reach
~500 subscribed GMT users, one of which is likely to know the solution
to your problem. To add yourself to this mailinglist (which is maintained
by the listserver program), you must send mail to the <A HREF="mailto:listserv@soest.hawaii.edu">listserver</A>
with a 1-line message. E.g., if your name is John Smith then send

<P><B>subscribe gmthelp John Smith</B>

<P>The listserver will automatically obtain your email address.  If you need to
unsubscribe, send another 1-line message to the listserver:
<P><B>unsubscribe gmthelp</B>

<P>
To browse previously posted messages, Stephan Eickschen (eicksch@gfz-potsdam.de)
maintains a <A HREF="http://op.gfz-potsdam.de/GMT-Help/">GMT Mailing List Archive</A>.

<P>There is a second mailinglist that is only used by the GMT developers
to broadcast infrequent messages regarding bug fixes and updates. Users
cannot post to this mailinglist. To stay informed of new developments,
send mail to the <A HREF="mailto:listserv@soest.hawaii.edu">listserver</A>
replacing gmthelp with <B>gmtgroup</B> in the message example above. Note:
the GMT developers monitor both lists and are aware of all submissions
allthough they may not respond personally to each message.

<P>Occasionally, a frustrated new GMT user will convince him/herself
that their work is so important that they are justified in digging up our
phone numbers and calling us directly to get personal attention to their
problem. Please don't even <B>think</B> about doing this unless you are
prepared to pay our standard consulting fee of USD 200 per hour.&nbsp;

Availability of GMT source code</H2>
The GMT package is available via anonymous ftp from several servers; they
all contain the same files as the main server in Hawaii. Because of file
sizes you are strongly encouraged to use the server closest to you.
We distribute a Bourne shell script (install_gmt) that automatically will
ftp the required archives from the ftp site you choose.  For users
with a slow Internet-connection and users who desire large amounts
of supplemental data sets to use with GMT: See the <B>GMT Companion CD-ROM</B>
product distributed by <A HREF="http://www.geoware-online.com"><B>Geoware</B></A>.
<HR>

<h2>Obtaining and Installing GMT</h2>

<OL>
<LI> <B>UNIX or LINUX:</B>
Because of the size of the archives we suggest you verify that you have
<A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2/index.html">bzip2</A> on your system.
If not, it is worth installing (executables for most platforms are available)
since *.bz2 files are much smaller than the *.gz files.  For instance, the
entire GMT package is ~50 Mb with bzip2 and 75 Mb with gzip.
<P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Automated install [Recommended]</I>.
Obtain and install GMT by interacting with the <A HREF="gmt/gmt_install_form.html">INSTALL FORM</A> on the web.
Follow instructions there to obtain an Bourne shell install-script and a customized install parameter file.  The
automated install can also install netCDF as part of the installation.
<LI><I>Manual install</I>.
If you prefer, you can also do the typical manual install by ftping the files, untar,
run configure, make etc.  Read the README file for the required steps.
For manual install you must also manually get and install the <A HREF="ftp://unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.Z">Unidata
netCDF library</A>, version 3.4 or higher, which GMT requries.
For your convenience, this library is also available from the GMT ftp sites.
</OL>
<P>

<LI> <B>WINDOWS:</B>
<OL>
<LI><I>DOS batch files rule</I>.
All the archives are also available as *.zip files.  In addition, two extra files can be found:
GMT_exe.zip contains main GMT executables, and GMT_suppl_exe.zip contains executables for the supplements.
Note that many of the DOS example scripts utilize GNU awk; the WIN32 executable
<A HREF="ftp://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/pub/gmt/gawk303x.zip">gawk</A>
has therefore been placed on all ftp sites.
A precompiled <A HREF="ftp://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/pub/gmt/netcdf-3.5.0_win32bin.zip">netCDF</A>
library for Windows is also available, and needed for GMT to compile and run (even if you only get the executables).
For your convenience, this library is also available from the GMT ftp sites.  For a InstallShield CD-ROM installation
option, see <A HREF="http://www.geoware-online.com"><B>Geoware</B></A>.
<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part I</I>.
Because you cannot get much done with DOS batch jobs, we strongly recommend that you install
<A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin">Cygwin</A>, a free Unix emulation package for Windows.
Cygwin lets you open a bash command window and comes with a suite of
standard Unix tools such as tcsh, gcc, etc.  You would then install GMT as described above for Unix/Linux.
<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part II</I>.
If you run Windows NT/2000, you can get access to csh command windows by installing the commercial
product <A HREF="http://www.interix.com">Interix</A>, a Unix environment for Windows.
Interix lets you install GMT as described for Unix/Linux above.  Recently, Interix was
gobbled up by Microsoft.
</OL>
<P>

<LI> <B>OS/2: </B>
GMT has been ported to OS/2.  For information and precompiled executables, see Allen Cogbill's
<A HREF="http://internet.cybermesa.com/~acogbill/gmt/gmt4os2.html">GMT OS/2 page</A>.
<P>

<LI> <B>MacIntosh: </B>
<OL>
<LI><I>Running Linux</I>.
If you run Linux on your Mac, follow the steps above for automatic install under UNIX or LINUX (1.1).
<LI><I>Running MacOS X or MacOS X Server</I>.
GMT installs and runs under MacOS X which is Unix-based (follow instructions for
UNIX/Linux in 1.1). 
<LI><I>Running MacOS 9</I>.
GMT does not run directly under MacOS 9 or earlier.  However, you can run GMT
using the commercial <A HREF="http://www.tenon.com/products/machten">Machten</A> Unix emulation package.  When
Machten is installed, GMT can be installed as under 1.1 above.

<h2>GMT master and mirror sites</h2>
You only need to visit one of these sites if you cannot do the automatic Unix/Linux install under 1.1 above.<P>

<h2>Post-Installation Notes</h2>
<UL>
<LI>The latest compressed tar archives for version 3.4 were created April
18, 2001.  See the list of <A HREF="gmt/gmt_bugs.html">known bugs</A> since the creation
of the archive - use this information to temporarily fix these problems.</LI>
<LI>The latest version may have caused a few cases of <A HREF="gmt/gmt_arrrghh.html">backward incompability</A>
with previous versions, so you may need to modify your custom scripts.</LI>
<LI>You can also check out <A HREF="gmt/gmt_news.html">the latest news</A> about
