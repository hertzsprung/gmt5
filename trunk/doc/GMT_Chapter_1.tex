\chapter{Preface} 
\thispagestyle{headings}

While \GMT\ has served the map-making and data processing needs of scientists since 1988\footnote{when
version 1.0 was released at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory}, the current global use was
heralded by the first official release in {\it EOS Trans. AGU} in the fall of 1991.  Since then,
\GMT\ has grown to become a standard tool for many Earth and Ocean scientists.  Development
has at times been rapid, and numerous releases have seen the light of day since the early versions.
For a history of the changes from release to release, see the online
\htmladdnormallink{Release Announcements}{http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/gmt_releases.html}
and the file \filename{CHANGES} in the main \GMT\ directory.

The success of \GMT\ is to a large degree due to the input of the user community. In fact, most of the
capabilities and options in \GMT\ programs were driven by user requests.
We would like to hear from you should you have any suggestions for future enhancements and modification.
Please send your comments to
