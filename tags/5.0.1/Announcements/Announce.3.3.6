Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT 3.3.6.
This version fixes numerous bugs, only some of which have
been listed on our official errata page; for more details
follow the Release link on the GMT web page
(http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt).

While mostly dealing with bugfixes, a few new options
have been added to some programs in GMT 3.3.6:

1. grdmath has added many new operators: EXTREMA, LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT,
   NAN, ISNAN, XOR, MODE, MAD, LMSSCL, TDIST, FDIST, CHIDIST, UPPER,
   and LOWER
   
2. gmtmath has added many new operators: LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT, NAN
   ISNAN, XOR, MODE, MAD, LMSSCL, TDIST, FDIST, CHIDIST, UPPER,
   INT, SUM, and LOWER
   
3. New Bourne script front-end dealing with Sandwell/Smith *.img
   files.  The script img2grd calls img2mercgrd and optionally will
   convert the Mercatorized grid to geographic using grdproject. 

4. New formats 7-11 for netcdf files with byte, char, short, int,
   and double arrays to complement the default GMT floats.  Thanks
   goes to Masakazu Higaki, JMA for implementing this feature.

5. Added the GSHHS tools as a new supplement.  The binary data
   files must be obtained separately as before.

Finally, the install_gmt script that assists in the installation
of GMT has been rewritten in the Bourne shell syntax which should
ensure that the script can be used on any platform running any
version of a Unix-like operating system or emulator.
The latest files were updated on October 17, 2000.

Sincerely,

Paul Wessel
Walter H. F. Smith
