Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.2.0.
For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

At this point, the US mirrors have synced up, and we expect
the others to follow within 24 hours.  Note the Australia
mirror is still down.


Sincerely,

The GMT Team
