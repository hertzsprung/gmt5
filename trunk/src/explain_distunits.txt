.SH UNITS
For map distance unit, append IT(unit) BD(d) for arc degree, BD(m) for arc minute, and BD(s) for arc second,
or BD(e) for meter [Default], BD(f) for foot, BD(k) for km, BD(M) for statute mile, BD(n) for nautical mile, and BD(u) for US survey foot.
By default we compute such distances using a spherical approximation with great circles. Prepend
BD(-) to a distance (or the unit is no distance is given) to perform "Flat Earth" calculations
(quicker but less accurate) or prepend BD(+) to perform exact geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate).
