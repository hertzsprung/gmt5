.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpscontour\fP reads an ASCII [or binary] xyz-file and produces a raw contour plot by triangulation.  By default, the
optimal Delaunay triangulation is performed (using either Shewchuk's [1996]\"'
or Watson's [1982] method as selected during \fBGMT\fP installation; type
\fBpscontour \-\fP to see which method is selected), but the user\"'
may optionally provide a second file with
network information, such as a triangular mesh used for finite element modeling.  In addition to contours, the area between contours may be painted according to
the color palette file.
.TP
\fIxyzfile\fP
Raw ASCII (or binary, see \fB\-b\fP) xyz data to be contoured.
.TP
.B \-C
name of the color palette file.  Must have discrete colors if you want to paint the
surface (\fB\-I\fP).  Only contours that have annotation flags set will be annotated.
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
#include "explain_-R.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-A
Give - to disable all annotations.
The optional \fIlabelinfo\fP controls the specifics of the label formatting and consists of a concatenated string
made up of any of the following control arguments:
.br
#include "explain_labelinfo.txt"
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-D
Dump the (x,y,z) coordinates of each contour to separate files, one for each contour segment. The
files will be named \fIdumpfile_cont_segment[_i]\fP.xyz, where \fIcont\fP is the contour value and
\fIsegment\fP is a running segment number for each contour interval (for closed contours we append _i.)
However, when \fB\-M\fP is used in conjunction with \fB\-D\fP a single multisegment file is created instead.
#include "explain_-E.txt"
#define CONTOUR
.TP
.B \-G
#include "explain_contlabel.txt"
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-I
Color the triangles using the color palette table.
#include "explain_-Jz.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Draw the underlying triangular mesh using the specified pen attributes [Default is no mesh].
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
.TP
.B \-M
When used in conjunction with \fB\-D\fP a single multisegment file is created, and
each contour section is preceded by a header record whose first column is \fIflag\fP
followed by the contour level.
.TP
.B \-N
Do NOT clip contours or image at the boundaries [Default will clip to fit inside region \fB\-R\fP].
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-S
Skip all input \fIxyz\fP points that fall outside the region [Default uses all the data in the triangulation].
.TP
.B \-T
Give name of file with network information.  Each record must contain triplets of
node numbers for a triangle [Default computes these using Delaunay triangulation (see \fBtriangulate\fP)].
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Select contouring and set contour pen attributes.  If the \fB+\fP flag is set then
the contour lines are colored according to the cpt file (see \fB\-C\fP).
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
#include "explain_-XY.txt"
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 3 input columns].
Use 4-byte integer triplets for node ids (\fB\-T\fP).
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default is 3 output columns].
#include "explain_-c.txt"
#include "explain_pen.txt"
#include "explain_color.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To make a raw contour plot from the file topo.xyz and drawing the contours (pen = 2)
given in the color palette file topo.cpt on a Lambert map
at LEN_L inch/degree along the standard parallels 18 and 24, use 
.br
.sp
\fBpscontour\fP topo.xyz \fB\-R\fP320/330/20/30 SCALE_L \fB\-C\fPtopo.cpt \fB\-W\fP0.5\fBp\fP > topo.ps
.br
.sp
To create a color \fIPostScript\fP plot of the numerical temperature solution obtained on a triangular mesh
whose node coordinates and temperatures are stored in temp.xyz and mesh arrangement is given by the file mesh.ijk, using
the colors in temp.cpt, run
.br
.sp
\fBpscontour\fP temp.xyz \fB\-R\fP0/150/0/100 \fB\-Jx\fP0.1 \fB\-C\fPtemp.cpt \fB\-G \-W\fP0.25\fBp\fP > temp.ps
.SH BUGS
Sometimes there will appear to be thin lines of the wrong color in the image.
This is a round-off problem which may be remedied by using a higher value of
\fBDOTS_PR_INCH\fP in the \.gmtdefaults4 file.
