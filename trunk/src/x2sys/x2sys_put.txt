.SH NAME
x2sys_put \- Update x2sys track data bases
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_put\fP [ \fIinfo.tbf\fP ] OPT(T)\fITAG\fP [ GMT_V_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_put\fP accepts a track bin-index file created by \fBx2sys_binlist\fP and
adds this information about the data tracks to the relevant data base.
The x2sys \fITAG\fP must match the tag encoded in the \fIinfo.tbf\fP file.  To
inquire about tracks in the data base, use \fBx2sys_get\fP.
#include "explain_tag.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
\fIinfo.tbf\fP
Name of a single track bin file.  If not given, stdin will be read.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To add the information stored in the track bin-index file latest.tbf to the track data bases
associated with the tag MGD77, try

\fBx2sys_put\fP latest.tbf OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 
.SH X2SYS DATABASES
The \fBx2sys_put\fP utility adds new information to the x2sys data bases.  These consists of
two files: The first file contains a listing of all the tracks that have been added to the system;
it is named \fITAG\fP_tracks.d and is in ASCII format.  The second file is named \fITAG\fP_index.b
and is in native binary format.  It contains information on which tracks cross each of the bins,
and what data sets were observed while crossing the bin.  The bins are defined by the OPT(R) and
OPT(I) options passed to \fBx2sys_init\fP when the \fITAG\fP was first initiated.  Both data base
files are stored in the \fB$X2SYS_HOME\fP/\fITAG\fP directory.  Do not attempt to edit these files by hand.
