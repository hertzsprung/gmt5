Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.4.0.
This release fixes several problems and adds new functionality
and is therefore a highly recommended upgrade from 4.3.1.
It also introduces a new program (greenspline) for gridding and
interpolation using Green's function splines.  Note that
there is no change to GSHHS which still is version 1.10.

For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).

As of this notice, the Oslo, NOAA, SOEST, Sydney, and Brazil
ftp servers are now updated; the others will follow within
24 hours (we hope).

Sincerely,

The GMT Team
