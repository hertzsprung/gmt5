.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpstext\fP plots textstrings of variable size, font type, and orientation.
Various map projections are provided, with the option to draw and annotate the
map boundaries. \fIPostScript\fP code is written to standard output.  Greek
characters, subscript, superscript, and small caps are supported as follows:
The sequence @~ toggles between the selected font and Greek (Symbol).
@%\fIno\fP% sets the font to \fIno\fP; @%% resets the font to the starting font,
@- toggles subscripts on/off, @+ toggles superscript on/off, and @# toggles small
caps on/off.  @@ prints the @ sign.  @e, @o, @a, @E, @O, @A give the accented
Scandinavian characters.  Composite characters (overstrike) may be indicated with
the @!<char1><char2> sequence, which will print the two characters on top of
each other.  To learn the octal codes for symbols not available on the keyboard
and some accented European characters, see Section 4.16 and Appendix F in the
\fBGMT\fP Technical Reference and Cookbook.  Note that \fBCHAR_ENCODING\fP must be
set to and extended character set in your \.gmtdefaults4 file in order to use the accented characters.
Using the \fB\-W\fP option, a colored rectangle underlying the text may
be plotted  (Does not work for strings with sub/super scripts, symbols, or composite
characters, except in paragraph mode (\fB\-M\fP)).
.TP
\fItextfile\fP
This file contains 1 or more records with (\fIx, y, size, angle, fontno, justify, text\fP).
If no file is given, \fBpstext\fP will read standard input.
\fIsize\fP is text size in points, \fIangle\fP is measured in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal, 
\fIfontno\fP sets the font type, \fIjustify\fP sets the alignment. 
If \fIfontno\fP is not an integer, then it is taken to be a textstring with the desired fontname.  See the \fBgmtdefaults\fP man page
for names and numbers of available fonts (or run \fBpstext \-L\fP).  The alignment refers to the
part of the textstring that will be mapped onto the (\fIx,y\fP) point.  Choose a 2 character combination
of L, C, R (for left, center, or right) and T, M, B for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., BL for lower left.

#include "explain_-R.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-C
Sets the clearance between the text and the surrounding box [15%].
Only used if \fB\-W\fP is specified.  Append the unit you want (\fBc\fPm, \fBi\fPnch, \fBm\fPeter.
or \fBp\fPoint; if not given we consult \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP) or % for a percentage of the font size.
.TP
.B \-D
Offsets the text from the projected (\fIx,y\fP) point by \fIdx,dy\fP [0/0].
Use \fB-Dj\fP to offset the text away from the point instead (i.e. the text's justification\"'
will determine the direction of the shift).  Optionally, append \fBv\fP which will draw a line
from the original point to the shifted point; append a \fIpen\fP to change the attributes for this line.
.TP
.B \-E
Sets the viewpoint's azimuth and elevation (for perspective view) [180/90].\"'
(Not implemented for paragraph mode).
.TP
.B \-G
Sets the gray-shade (0-255) or color (r/g/b, each 0-255) used for drawing the text.  [Default is black]
#include "explain_-H.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Lists the font-numbers and font-names available, then exits.
.TP
.B \-M
Paragraph mode.  Files must be multiple segment files.  Segments are separated by
a special record whose first character must be \fIflag\fP [Default is '>'].
Starting in the 3rd column, we expect to find information pertaining to the
typesetting of a text paragraph (the remaining lines until next segment header).
The information expected is (x y size angle fontno justify linespace parwidth parjust),
where \fIx y size angle fontno justify\fP are defined above, while \fIlinespace\fP
and \fIparwidth\fP are the linespacing and paragraph width, respectively.  The justification
of the text paragraph is governed by \fIparjust\fP which may be \fBl\fP(eft), \fBc\fP(enter),
\fBr\fP(ight), or \fBj\fP(ustified).  The segment header is followed by one or more lines
with paragraph text.  Text may contain the escape sequences discussed above as well as three
more: @;\fIr/g/b\fP; changes the font color (@;; resets it), @:\fIsize\fP: changes the
font size (@:: resets it), and @_ toggles underline on/off.  Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
.TP
.B \-N
Do NOT clip text at map boundaries [Default will clip].
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-S
Draw text outline. Append pen attributes.
(Not implemented for paragraph mode).
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
Paint a rectangle beneath the text string.  Set color [Default is no fill].
Append \fBo\fP to draw rectangle outline, add a \fIpen\fP to specify pen attributes [width = 1, color = black,
texture = solid].
Choose upper case \fBO\fP to get a rounded rectangle.
Choose lower case \fBc\fP to get a concave rectangle (only in paragraph mode).
Choose upper case \fBC\fP to get a convex rectangle (only in paragraph mode).
#include "explain_-XY.txt"
.TP
.B \-Z
For 3-D projections:  Sets the z-level of the basemap [0].
(Not implemented for paragraph mode).
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-c.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To plot the outlines of the textstrings stored in the file text.d on a Mercator plot with
the given specifications, use

To add a typeset figure caption for a 3-inch wide illustration, use

.sp

.SH BUGS
In paragraph mode, the presence of composite
characters and other escape sequences may lead to unfortunate word splitting. 
.br
The \fB\-N\fP option does not adjust the BoundingBox information so you may
have to post-process the PostScript outout with epstool or ps2epsi to obtain
a correct BoundingBox.
