To file a bug report, please send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:gmt-help@hawaii.edu">GMT Help</A>.
Note that due to the ever-growing presence of spam, you will need to subscribe to this mailing-list
in order to post.  We apologize if this may be a hassle to you, but it saves the 1000+ subscribers
from seeing all the junk spam otherwise would get through.
Make sure your email includes the following information:
<UL>
<LI>Version of GMT you are using.
<LI>Hardware platform and Operating System, including version.
<LI>Individual GMT program that may have a bug.
<LI>A clear explanation of the problem.
<LI>Example script or command line and, if necessary, test data that
recreate the problem.  If the problem occurs for a huge
data set, try to see if the problem can be reproduced with
a smaller subset.  Do not attach data files that
exceed one Mb - we will contact you should we need further
information.
<LI>Other pieces of relevant information
</UL>
Note that sometimes a work-around can be crafted while waiting for the next release.  You may want
to check the <A HREF="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wiki/index.php/Generic_Mapping_Tools" target="_blank">SOEST GMT Wiki</A>
to see if anything relevant have been added.
