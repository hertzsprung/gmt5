.SH NAME
gshhs \- Extract ASCII listings from binary GSHHS or WDBII data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgshhs\fP \fIbinaryfile.b\fP [ OPT(I)\fIid\fP ] [ OPT(L) ] [ OPT(M) ] > \fIasciifile.txt\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgshhs\fP reads the binary coastline (GSHHS) or political boundary or river (WDBII) files and
extracts an ASCII listing.  It automatically handles byte-swabbing between different
architectures.  Optionally, only segment header info can be displayed.  The header info has
the format \fIID npoints  hierarchical-level source area west east south north container ancestor\fP,
where hierarchical levels for coastline polygons go from 1 (shoreline) to 4 (lake inside
island inside lake inside land).  Source is either W (World Vector Shoreline) or C (CIA World
Data Bank II); lower case is used if a lake is a river-lake. The \fIwest east south north\fP is the enclosing rectangle, area the polygon
area in km^2, container is the ID of the polygon that contains this polygon (-1 if none),
and ancestor is the ID of the polygon in the full resolution set that was reduced to this polygon (-1 if full resolution).
.TP
\fIbinaryfile.b\fP
GSHHS or WDBII binary data file as distributed with the GSHHS data supplement.  Any of the
5 standard resolutions (full, high, intermediate, low, crude) can be used.
.TP
OPT(I)
Only output information for the polygon that matches \fIid\fP [default outputs all polygons].
.TP
OPT(L)
Only output a listing of polygon or line segment headers [default outputs headers and data records].
.TP
OPT(M)
Start all header records with the GMT multiple segment indicator '>' [Default uses P for polygons
and L for lines].
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To convert the entire intermediate GSHHS binary data to ASCII, run
.sp
\fBgshhs\fP gshhs_i.b > gshhs_i.txt
.sp
To only get a listing of the headers for the river data set at full resolution, try
.sp
\fBgshhs\fP wdb_rivers_f.b OPT(L) > riverlisting.txt
.SH BUGS
While the GSHHS data is organized as a set of closed polygons, the rivers and boundary
data are just a set of line segments in no particular order.  Thus, it is not possible
to extract information pertaining to just one river or one country.
