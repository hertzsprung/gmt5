GMT_bi_OPT
Selects binary input.  Append one or more comma-separated combinations of
[IT(n)]IT(type), where IT(type) is one of BD(c) (signed byte),
BD(u) (unsigned byte), BD(h) (signed 2-byte int), BD(H) (unsigned
2-byte int), BD(i) (signed 4-byte int), BD(I) (unsigned 4-byte int),
BD(l) (signed 8-byte int), BD(L) (unsigned 8-byte int), BD(f)
(4-byte single-precision float), and BD(d) (8-byte double-precision
float).  Append BD(w) to any item to force byte-swapping.
Alternatively, append BD(+L)|BD(B) to indicate that the entire data file
should be read as little- or big-endian, respectively.
Here, IT(n) is the number of each item in your binary input file; the
total number may exceeds the columns actually needed by the program.  If no
IT(n) is specified we assume that IT(type) applies to all columns and
that IT(n) is implied by the expectation of the program.
Alternatively, append BD(c) if the input file is netCDF. Optionally,
append IT(var1)BD(/)IT(var2)BD(/)IT(...) to specify the variables to be read.
