.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmtselect\fP is a filter that reads (longitude, latitude) positions from the first 2 columns of \fIinfiles\fP [or standard input] and
uses a combination of 1-5 criteria to pass or reject the records.  Records can be selected based on whether or not they are
1) inside a rectangular region (\fB\-R\fP [and \fB\-J\fP]), 2) within \fIdist\fP km of any point in \fIptfile\fP,
3) within \fIdist\fP km of any line in \fIlinefile\fP, 4) inside one of the polygons in the \fIpolygonfile\fP, and 5) inside geographical features (based on coastlines).
The sense of the tests can be reversed for each of these 5 criteria by using the \fB\-I\fP option.
See option \fB\-:\fP on how to read (latitude,longitude) files.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIinfiles\fP
ASCII (or binary, see\fB\-b\fP) data file(s) to be operated on.  If not given, standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Ignored unless \fB\-N\fP is set.  Geographical features with an area smaller than \fImin_area\fP
in km^2 or of hierarchical level that is lower than \fImin_level\fP or higher than \fImax_level\fP
will be ignored [Default is 0/4 (all features)]. See DATABASE INFORMATION in the \fBpscoast\fP man-pages for more details.
.TP
.B \-C
Pass all records whose location is within \fIdist\fP of any of the points in the ascii file \fIptfile\fP.  If \fIdist\fP
is zero then the 3rd column of \fIptfile\fP must have each point's individual radius of influence.  Distances are in user units; specify
\fB\-fg\fP or a map projection to indicate distances in km.  Prepend \fBf\fP to indicate you want approximate flat
earth distance calculations (faster) than exact great circle calculations (slower).
.TP
.B \-D
Ignored unless \fB\-N\fP is set.  Selects the resolution of the coastline data set to use ((\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, or (\fBc\fP)rude).  The
resolution drops off by ~80% between data sets. [Default is \fBl\fP].  Note that because the coastlines differ in details is not guaranteed that a point will remain inside [or outside] when a different resolution is selected.
.TP
.B \-F
Pass all records whose location is within one of the closed polygons in the multiple-segment
ascii file \fIpolygonfile\fP.
#include "explain_-H.txt"
.TP
.B \-I
Reverses the sense of the test for each of the criteria specified:
.br
	\fBc\fP  select records NOT inside any point's circle of influence.
.br
	\fBf\fP  select records NOT inside any of the polygons.
.br
	\fBl\fP  select records NOT within the specified distance of any line.
.br
	\fBr\fP  select records NOT inside the specified rectangular region.
.br
	\fBs\fP  select records NOT considered inside as specified by \fB\-A, \-D, \-N\fP.
#include "explain_-j.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Pass all records whose location is within \fIdist\fP of any of the line segments in the multiple-segment ascii
file \fIlinefile\fP.  If \fIdist\fP is zero then the 2nd column of each sub-header in the \fIptfile\fP must have each lines's individual distance value.
Distances are in user units; specify \fB\-fg\fP or a map projection to indicate distances in km. 
.TP
.B \-M
Multiple segment file.  Segments are separated by a record whose first character is \fIflag\fP.
[Default is '>'].
.TP
.B \-N
Pass all records whose location is inside specified geographical features.
Specify if records should be \fBs\fPkipped or \fBk\fPkept using 1 of 2 formats:
.br
	\fB\-N\fP\fIwet/dry\fP.
.br
	\fB\-N\fP\fIocean/land/lake/island/pond\fP.
.br
Append \fBo\fP to let points exactly on feature boundaries be considered outside the feature [Default is inside]. [Default is s/k/s/k/s (i.e., s/k), which passes all points on dry land].
#include "explain_-R.txt"
If no map projection is supplied we implicitly set \fB\-Jx\fP1.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-i.txt"
#include "explain_-n.txt"
[Default is 2 input columns].
#include "explain_-o.txt"
#include "explain_-n.txt"
#include "explain_-f.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To extract the subset of data set that is within 300 km of any of the points in pts.d but more than
100 km away from the lines in lines.d, run
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP lonlatfile \fB\-Jd\fP1d \fB\-C\fP300/pts.d \fB\-L\fP100/lines.d \fB\-Il\fP > subset
.br
.sp
Here, you must specify a map projection so that knows you are giving it geographical data (otherwise
300 would be interpreted as Cartesian distance in x-y units instead of km).
.br
.sp
To keep all points in data.d except those on land, as determined by the high-resolution
coastlines, use
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP data.d \fB\-R\fP120/121/22/24 \fB\-Dh\fP \fB\-Ns\fP/\fBk\fP > subset
