.SH NAME
gmtcolors \- Explanation of color codes in BD(GMT)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Colors can be specified in BD(GMT) as arguments to commands, generally as part of the OPT(G) or OPT(W) options
to select polygon fill or outline pen. Colors are also used in color pallette tables (cpt files) that help convert
numerical values to colors.
.br
BD(GMT) allows several ways to represent a color:
.TP
.B Colorname
Specify one of the named colors below. All names are case-insensitive.
.TP
.B R/G/B
Specify BD(R)ed, BD(G)reen, and BD(B)lue levels. Each value is separated by a slash and is in the range from 0 (dark) to 255 (light).
This representation is used to color monitors.
.TP
.B #RRGGBB
Specify BD(R)ed, BD(G)reen, and BD(B)lue levels in the way that it is done in HTML. Use two characters for
each color channel, ranging from 00 (dark) to FF (light). Upper and lower case are allowed.
.TP
.B Graylevel
For shades of gray, R = G = B, and only one number needs to be used.
This representation is popular with black and white printers.
.TP
.B H-S-V
Specify BD(H)ue in the range 0 to 360 (degrees), BD(S) saturation between 0 (not saturated) and 1 (fully saturated), and
value BD(V) between 0 (dark) and 1 (light). Number are separated by hyphens.
This representation can be helpful when hue varies a lot.
.TP
.B C/M/Y/K
Specify BD(C)yan, BD(M)agenta, BD(Y)ellow, and blacBD(K). Each number is in the range from 0 (no paint) to 1 (maximum paint).
This representation is used by most color printers.
