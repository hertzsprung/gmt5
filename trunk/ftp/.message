This server is one of six mirror sites for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT).
Current version is 3.4

The mirror sites are:

gmt.soest.hawaii.edu	 : SOEST [GMT Website], Honolulu, Hawaii, USA
falcon.grdl.noaa.gov	 : NOAA, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA
ftp.geologi.uio.no	 : IFG, Institute for Geology, Oslo, Norway
ftp.iag.usp.br		 : IAG-USP, Sao Paulo, BRAZIL
ftp.eos.hokudai.ac.jp	 : ISV, Hokkaido U, Sapporo, JAPAN
life.csu.edu.au:	 : Charles Sturt U, Albury, AUSTRALIA

Pls select a site near you since GMT archives are very large.

We recommend that you get the Bourne script install_gmt and type
sh install_gmt in the directory in which GMT3.4 should be installed.
The script will do all the ftp'ing and installation automatically.
It can also be used after ftp'ing the files manually. install_gmt
can also take an argument file which you can assemble interactively
at gmt.soest.hawaii.edu

Alternatively, you can ftp the files manually and follow the README.
Files are available in both .bz2, .gz, and .zip format.  The former are
_much_ smaller.  If you do not have bzip2, see sourceware.cygnus.com.

The files you MUST HAVE are (Windows: substitute .zip for tar.bz2)

GMT_progs.tar.bz2	All program code
GMT_share.tar.bz2	Standard support data and coastlines

You probably want to get these also:

GMT_ps.tar.bz2		PS version of documentation
GMT_pdf.tar.bz2		PDF documentation and Unix man pages
GMT_man.tar.bz2		Unix man pages for GMT
GMT_web.tar.bz2		HTML versions of all documentation
GMT_tut.tar.bz2		Tutorial data sets
GMT_script.tar.bz2	20 Example scripts and data
GMT_suppl.tar.bz2	Supplemental programs for GMT
triangle.tar.bz2	Faster, but copyrighted triangulation
install_gmt		Automates the installation (csh script)

Finally, you probably want to get:

GMT_full.tar.bz2	Full resolution coastline data
GMT_high.tar.bz2	High resolution coastline data

Windows user who don't want to compile GMT can also get:

GMT_exe.zip		Zip file with precompiled executables for win32.
GMT_suppl_exe.zip	Same for supplemental programs
