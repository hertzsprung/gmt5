.TP
GMT_U_OPT
Draw Unix System time stamp on plot.
By adding IT(just/dx/dy/), the user may specify the justification of the stamp and
where the stamp should fall on the page relative to lower left corner of the plot.
For example, BL/0/0 will align the lower left corner of the time stamp with the lower left corner of the plot.
Optionally, append a IT(label), or BD(c) (which will plot the command string.).
The BD(GMT) parameters BD(MAP_LOGO), BD(MAP_LOGO_POS), and BD(FORMAT_TIME_LOGO) can affect the appearance;
see the BD(gmt.conf) man page for details.
The time string will be in the locale set by the environment variable BD(TZ) (generally local time).
