.SH VECTOR ATTRIBUTES
Several modifiers may be appended to the OPT(Sm), OPT(SM), OPT(Sv), OPT(SV), and OPT(S=) options
to specify placement of vector heads, their shapes, and the justification of the vector:
.br
.sp
MOD(a)IT(angle) sets the angle of the vector head apex [30].
.br
MOD(b) places a vector head at the beginning of the vector path [none].
.br
MOD(e) places a vector head at the end of the vector path [none].
.br
MOD(l) draws half-arrows, using only the left side [both].
.br
MOD(r) draws half-arrows, using only the right side [both].
.br
MOD(n)IT(norm) scales down vector attributes (pen thickness, head size) with decreasing length,
where vectors shorter than IT(norm) will have their
attributes scaled by length/IT(norm) [arrow attributes remains invariant to length].
.br
.sp
In addition, OPT(Sm), OPT(Sv), OPT(SV) may also take these modifiers:
.br
.sp
MOD(j)IT(just) determines how the input IT(x),IT(y) point relates
to the vector.  Choose from BD(b)eginning [default], BD(e)nd, or BD(c)enter.
.br
MOD(s) means the input IT(angle), IT(length) is instead the IT(x), IT(y) coordinates
of the vector end point.
