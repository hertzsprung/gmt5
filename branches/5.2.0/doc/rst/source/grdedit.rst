Description
-----------

**grdedit** reads the header information in a binary 2-D grid file and
replaces the information with values provided on the command line [if
any]. As an option, global, geographical grids (with 360 degrees
longitude range) can be rotated in the east-west direction, and
individual nodal values can be replaced from a table of *x*, *y*, *z*
values. **grdedit** only operates on files containing a grdheader. Note:
If it is important to retain the original data you should work on a copy
of that file. 

Required Arguments
------------------

*grid*
    Name of the 2-D grid file to modify. (See GRID FILE FORMATS below).

`Optional Arguments <#toc5>`_
-----------------------------

**-A**
    If necessary, adjust the fileâ€™s *x\_inc*, *y\_inc* to be compatible
    with its domain (or a new domain set with **-R**). Older grid files
    (i.e., created prior to GMT 3.1) often had excessive slop in
    *x\_inc*, *y\_inc* and an adjustment is necessary. Newer files are
    created correctly.
**-D**\ *xname*/*yname*/*zname*/*scale*/*offset*/*invalid*/*title*/*remark*
    Give values for *xname*, *yname*, *zname*, *scale*, *offset*,
    *invalid*, *title*, and *remark*. To leave some of these values untouched,
    leave field blank. Empty fields in the end may be skipped. Alternatively,
    to allow "/" to be part of one of the values, use any non-alphanumeric
    character (and not the equal sign) as separator by both starting and ending
    with it. For example:
    **-D**:*xname*:*yname*:*zname*:*scale*:*offset*:*invalid*:*title*:*remark*:
**-E**
    Transpose the grid and exchange the *x* and *y* information.
    Incompatible with the other options.
**-N**\ *table*
    Read the ASCII (or binary; see **-bi**) file
    *table* and replace the corresponding nodal values in the grid with
    these *x*,\ *y*,\ *z* values. 

.. |Add_-R| replace:: The new w/e/s/n values will
    replace those in the grid, and the *x\_inc*, *y\_inc* values are
    adjusted, if necessary.
.. include:: explain_-R.rst_

**-S**
    For global, geographical grids only. Grid values will be shifted
    longitudinally according to the new borders given in **-R**.
**-T**
    Make necessary changes in the header to convert a
    gridline-registered grid to a pixel-registered grid, or vice-versa.
    Basically, gridline-registered grids will have their domain extended
    by half the x- and y-increments whereas pixel-registered grids will
    have their domain shrunk by the same amount.

Examples
--------

Let us assume the file data.nc covers the area 300/310/10/30. We want to
change the boundaries from geodetic longitudes to geographic and put a
new title in the header. We accomplish this by

   ::

    gmt grdedit data.nc -R-60/-50/10/30 -D/////"Gravity Anomalies"

The grid world.nc has the limits 0/360/-72/72. To shift the data so that
the limits would be -180/180/-72/72, use

   ::

    gmt grdedit world.nc -R-180/180/-72/72 -S

The file junk.nc was created prior to GMT 3.1 with incompatible
**-R** and **-I** arguments. To reset the x- and y-increments we run

   ::

    gmt grdedit junk.nc -A

The file junk.nc was created prior to GMT 4.1.3 and does not contain
the required information to indicate that the grid is geographic. To add
this information, run

   ::

    gmt grdedit junk.nc -fg
