.SH NAME
\fBx_remove\fP \- Remove COEs for Selected Cruises from the Data Base
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx_remove\fP \fIremovefile\fP [ \fB\-X\fP\fIxbase\fP ] [ \fB\-L\fP\fIlegbase\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx_remove\fP will read a list of 'bad' cruises, read the \fBXSYSTEM\fP data base files, and write out new
\fBXSYSTEM\fP files that do not include any COEs generated by the bad cruises. This is useful if certain
cruises turn out to have systematic errors (e.g. the topography values were inadvertently given as
fathoms instead of meters), and we would like to re-run \fBxover/xupdate\fP after the
systematic errors have been rectified. The new file names will consist of the old file names with
the suffix _new appended.
