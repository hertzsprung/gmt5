				used anywhere to convert users <nodata> values to NaN, and to do
				the reverse on output.

2014-03-26	remko
	* ps2raster.c:		Bug fix: -C should also apply when computing BoundingBox.

2014-03-03	pwessel
	* pslegend.c:		The flush_paragraph was not reset to false before 2nd loop,
				causing the text (T) option to fail if it was the first item.

	* grdmath.c:		New function LDISTG does LDIST while using GSHHG directly.

2014-01-10	pwessel
	* grdmath.c:		We consider the change in SDIST, PDIST to return degrees instead
				of km to be a bug as it makes it difficult to handle geodesics
				for which degrees make no sense.  Thus we have consolidated all
				the ?DIST operators to give km if geographic data are involved.
				Example 23 has been adjusted accordingly, as has several test
				scripts.  Please check your own scripts for SDIST.

2013-03-25	pwessel
	* greenspline.c:	Enhanced -Cv option to set desired level of variance explained.

2013-01-03	pwessel
	* grdcut.c:		Added option -S[n]lon/lat/radius to extract subset that contains all
				grid nodes that fall inside the circle, and optionally (-Sn) set those

				Returns a grid with all nodes set to the sum constant.
	* grdfilter.c:		Added -Ff<weight> which reads a weight gridfile for custom Cartesian
	 			grid convolution.  Must have odd dimensions.  Also added -Fo<weight>
				for operators whose weight sum is zero (hence don't sum and divide).

2012-09-28	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Allow for new length unit 'u' for US survey foot.
				Allow -R<unit>... and linear projection to imply a simple

				trouble with special symbols in basemaps.

2012-09-03	remko
	* gmt_io.c:		Option -ff will now prevent gmt_nc_fopen from altering the data
				type to GMT_IS_LON|LAT|RELTIME. This is to address issue #134.

	* gmtvector.c:		Incorrectly applied flat-Earth adjustment for 2-D Cartesian azimuth.

2012-06-01	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Reading files with one segment header and no data caused a SEGV.

2012-05-31	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		With -R...r and -JE, pscoast could end up trying to paint a
				block that is outside the rectangular region yet whose projection
				completely contains the region.
	* gmt_support.c:	In GMT_crossover(), could get near-duplicate crossovers near a
				node.  Now checks there are no such consecutive duplicates.

				of the higher data value unless -Er- is given (return lower).
	* blockmode.c:		---"---

2012-05-11	pwessel
	* gmtmath.c:		Operators UPPER and LOWER did not assign output to rows

2012-03-17	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Did not sense EOF if last record was a header.
	* spotter/libspotter.c:	A very long filename would exceed variable space in spotter_GPlates_pair().
	* xgrid/xgridedit.c:	Fixed SEGV, but the new value assigned to a node still gets corrupted.

2012-03-16	remko
	* *.*.cmake:		Renamed things like config.h.cmake to config.h.in, because they are not
				cmake files.

	* *.c:		Did not consistently use COL_SEPARATOR and/or FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT for ascii output.

2012-02-22	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	gmt_inonout_sphpol_count did not properly handle line segments
				that were exactly vertical in all cases, leading to errors as
				to a point being inside or outside a spherical polygon.  Also,
				points exactly on a vertical segment were not flagged as being
				ON the line but INSIDE. Added test/grdmask/sphinout.sh as check.

2012-02-17	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Added convenience function GMT_set_segmentheader to change
				multi-seg header output to on or off; used by several GMT programs.
	* grdtrack.c:		Did not turn on multi-segment output for -C when input was not

				New Functions: GMT_fgets_chop GMT_strstrip GMT_cr2lf
				GMT_strlshift.
				Deleted: gmt_trim_line because it is obsolete.
				Simpliefied	DOS_path_fix.

2012-02-09	jluis
	* pslib.c, gmt_init.c:	On Windows DOS|psl_path_fix() test if the path has a leading
				'/cygdrive' that may have been set for example by Cygwin on
				declaring GMT_SHAREDIR. If yes chop it off. This makes easier
				to use Windows binaries on Cygwin.

2012-02-08	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		Improve tests to detect if the PS file is not closed (excess -K)
				Now also warns when creating a PDF file from a unclosed PS

2012-02-07	pwessel
	* psxy[z]:		For the two mixed symbol/line options -Sf and -Sq, we now
				examine the segment header for any changes to these options.

2012-02-07	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		On Windows the ghostscript executable path is now fetch from
				the registry. In case it fails, fall back to the old "get
				it from the path" mechanism.

2012-02-02	pwessel
	* pslegend.c:		Did not process -U, and had usage message about obsolete -S
	* gmt_proj.c:		For -JE, both projection center and antipode gave x = y = 0.
				Now, antipode results in NaN, NaN and a flag is set.

2012-01-31	pwessel
	* pstext.c:		Enhanced -DJ option will shorten diagonal offsets by sqrt(2) to
				maintain the same distance from point to annotation.

2012-01-30	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		On Windows the default name of the ghostscript executable
				is now that of the 64 bits version (gswin64c).

2012-01-25	remko
	* gmt_io.c:		GMT_GRDIO_RI_NOREPEAT should not be fatal.

2012-01-15	pwessel
	* minmax.c:		Determine if input data already lie on a regular lattice;
				if so, use the phase shifts in x,y to determine -R when -I
				is given, and allow -r to switch to pixel-registration.

2012-01-13	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	The quoted line labeling would not free an allocated label
				when the label had no text string.
	* pslib.c:		Added support so that the bit-flags passed into psl_vector
				and psl_mangle controls if vector heads are filled and
				outlined.
	* pslib.txt:		Updated documentation for the changes to vectors.
	* gmt_plot.c:		Let geo_vector also use the bit-flags to change vector head
				fill and outline.
	* minmax.c:		Added the -r option so that users who have pixel-registered
				xyz data can get correct -R via the -I option.
	* psxy[z].c:		Make sure we process the vector modifiers when read via input.

2012-01-10	jluis
	* gmt_customio.c:	GMT_gdal_read_grd was ignoring subregion requests like for
				instances "grdcut -R..." Such request would cause a crash.
	* gmt_gdalread.h:	Add members to inform GMT_gdalread on the coordinates
				registration type used when subregion requests.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Recognize web located files hose name starts with /vsicurl/...
	* gmt_io.c:				""

2012-01-10	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		-R0/360 and -JMlon/lat would not set global_map properly,
				giving NaNs as scale.

2012-01-09	pwessel
	* gmtmath.c:		The COL operator inadvertently set a pointer to NULL, then
				tried to use it.  Also, with operands whatsoever we crashed
				as the Template struct was deallocated twice.

2012-01-08	pwessel
	* grdcut.c:		The -Z would give incorrect -R for pixel grids.  Now also
				print warning if output grid equals input grid (no change).

2012-01-08      remko
	* xyz2grd.txt:		Added missing 'H' and 'I' to -Z options.
	* xyz2grd.c:		Bug fix: -Z..h etc needs to imply proper -bi setting.
	* gmt_io.c, gmtapi_util.c:	Bug fixes: now properly identifying all I/O types.
				Fixed incorrect swapping of signed integers (short and long).

2012-01-06	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		Made geo_vector properly adjust for half-head vectors
	* pslib.c:		Made psl_vector and psl_matharc adjust for half-head vectors
	* gmt_init.c:		Revised -Sf front syntax to use modifiers. Backwards compatible.
	* gmt_plot.c:		In GMT_xy_axis, string[GMT_CALSTRING_LENGTH] was used to hold
				labels that could be longer, leading to memory corruption.

2012-01-05	jluis
	* gmt_customio.c:	Make nx and ny of 'unsigned short int' type in surfer6 header.
				Note that original format specification by Golden Software
				clearly say they are 'short int' but this change shouldn't
				break anything and will allow dealing with larger grid sizes.

2012-01-04	pwessel
	* grdvector.c:		Updated -Q to take new vector specification format.
				Made -E obsolete (since covered by modifier +jc) but
				is still active under compatibility mode.
	* psrose.c:		Updated -M to take new vector specification format.
				Added -Wv<pen> to specify pen for vector (in -C).

2011-12-17	pwessel
	* psxyz.c:		Testing out geovector symbol
	* psxy.c:		Added usage/doc for -S= great-circle vector symbols
				for both psxy and psxyz.

2011-12-15	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Allow for multi-param symbols with geo-angles.

	* psldemo.c:		Added transparency example

2011-12-03	pwessel
	* gmtmath.c:		Did not check that -Tmin/max has min > max.

2011-12-03	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77track.c:	Did not set GMT's time system to Unix before dealing
				with dates.  Now done centrally by MGD77_Init.

2011-12-02	pwessel
	* project.c:		Fixed trouble with -G; this also fixes test cases.
				Added -Ginc[/colat][+] so if + is appended we get a
				segment header with information about the pole for the circle.
				Clarified that it is colatitude and not latitude we append.
				Furthermore, for -G<inc> -bo we failed to write any output;
				this was an old bug also affecting GMT 4.
	* gmt_plot.c:		The mysterious trim_label function was called for both axes
				even if only one had 2 levels of annotations.  Now check per
				axes and document the function better.  This fixes the hovmuller test.

2011-12-01	remko
	* meca/pscoupe.c:	Added -Q option to suppress mechanism files
				Incorporated distaz.c and submeca.c as they were unique to pscoupe.
				Properly mention -a<size>/<P_symbol><T_symbol>
				Properly set default pen for all elements to the one set by -W.
	* meca/psmeca.c:	Let -e<fill> and -g<fill> default to -E<fill> and -G<fill>.
				Set default size of T_symbol and P_symbol to 6p (not inch or cm)
	* meca/pscoupe.c:	==="===
	* meca/*.c:		Numerous bug fixes

2011-11-30	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_getfill got confused when a Windows path C:\etc was
				given as an pattern file (mixed up with :F and :B mechanism).
	* gmt_init.c:		Parsing of -B5+gp<dpi>/<dospath> suffered the same fate.

2011-11-29	pwessel
	* pslegend.c:		Fixed so we can mix filled and non-filled symbols.

2011-11-28	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		Extended the custom axis annotation to any map projection.

2011-11-28	pwessel

2011-11-22	pwessel
	* meca/utilmeca.c:	Use PSL_setfill and not PSL_setcolor to change fills
	* test/meca/meca_4.sh:	Need -B0 to just draw axes.
	* grdinfo.c:		Now report if grid is Geographic or Cartesian as part of registration message.

2011-11-21	pwessel
	* grdview.c:		Also, when nodes are adjusted by small to avoid matching a
				contour value exactly (during contouring), the same adjustment
				must be made later when those nodes are used to determine how
				to connect together polygons for fill.

2011-11-19	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Fix memory allocation bug in MGD77_Read_Header_Sequence() where
				it was reading MGD77_RECORD_LENGTH records into a shorter
				MGD77_HEADER_LENGTH longer variable.

2011-11-18	pwessel
	* *.c:			Make sure that incrementally allocated memory for structures
				that contain pointers is initialized to NULL before use.
	* grdview.c:		The contouring could suffer from the same round-off issues that
				affected grdcontour (and fixed back in 2004).  Now same fix is
				applied in grdview.  Also set -S to 0 as stated in man page;
				this matches default in grdcontour as well.

2011-11-17	pwessel
	* grdlandmask.c:	Now recognizes a global grid when nx*dx == 360 also.
	* nearneighbor.c:	--"--

	* gmt_init.c:		No longer accept lower case -x -y as in GMT 4 (inadvertently).

2011-11-13	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Need to reset zmin/zmax when region was temporarily expanded to
				include data boundary rows/cols.
	* grdinfo.c:		Modifier -Ts<dz> returns a symmetrical range about zero.
	* grdpaste.c:		Had trouble shuffling longitudes correctly for geographic grids.

2011-11-12	pwessel
	* gmtmercmap.c:		New example of API use: Create a shaded-relief Mercator map using
				Etopo 1|2|5m global relief, with optional color bar.  Option -D
				makes no map but writes equivalent Bourne shell or cshell script.

	* gmt_support.c:	Resampling of CPTs did not initialize the i_dz variables, resulting
				in discontinuous colors for continuous color maps.

2011-11-11	remko
	* pslib.c:		Fixed error in PSL_message (wrong verbosity handling)

2011-11-11	pwessel
	* gmtapi_util.c:	Introduce GMT_Retrieve_Data to return a pointer to a container
				that was allocated when a memory location was registered as the
				output.  Reduced GMT_Begin_IO to only apply to rec-by-rec i/o,
				hence we could remove the mode variable.  GMT_Register_IO now
				expects the pointer to the resource, not the pointer address.

2011-11-09	pwessel
	* gmtapi_util.c:	Let GMT_Get_Record's third argument (*n_fields) only return
				the number of fields if it is not NULL.

2011-11-08	pwessel
	* *.c:			All modules using GMT_Get_Data are now checking for a NULL
				return, and only then checking status.  This minimizes the
				number of checks during the processing of a data set.

2011-11-05	pwessel
	* gmtapi_util.c:	Added GMT_Write_Data and GMT_Read_Data which deals with
				files/streams, and GMT_Get_Data, GMT_Put_Data now work
				explicitly with registered object IDs.
				Test all return codes from API and give proper errors.
2011-10-29	pwessel
	* gmtapi_parse.c:	API finalized.  Simplified by let all functions that
				produce objects (Make, Find, Append) return a pointer to those objects.

2011-10-28	pwessel
	* gmtapi_util.c:	API finalized.  Simplified by eliminating unneeded arguments
				to GMT_Create_Data, GMT_Register_IO, and let all functions that
				produce objects (Create, Get) return a pointer to those objects.
	* grdpaste.c:		Must change both the grid pad and the default pad in this application.

2011-10-17	pwessel
	* gmtapi*.[ch]:		API modified to eliminate any void ** references or variables.
				API abstraction-layer functions now take void * instead and no
				casting to void * takes place, letting the compiler know what is
				going on.  Memory alloc/free macros changed similarly.
	* surface.c:		The -Lu<upperfile> instead applied the -Ll<lowerfile>.

2011-10-16	pwessel
	* triangulate.c:	Added -S to write triangle polygons and -Z to control use

	* gmtswitch.bat:	The Windows version of the *nix gmtswitch script

2011-06-23	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.c:		Now reads new GSHHS 2.2.0 format that includes feature areas

2011-05-26	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		GMT_wesn_clip needed to adjust longitudes to fit the given domain.
	* grdblend_func.c:	Must carefully set region passed to GMT_grdsample.
	* grdsample_func.c:	Must handle any +-360 offsets between header and -R for geo grids.

				both fill and pen to work.

2011-05-25	remko

				raw binary files (that, is without companion .hdr file)
				as well as SRTM1 and SRTM3 (with a .hgt extension)
	* gmt_io.c:		Add extra test ' && c != EOF' to GMT_fgets to avoid potential

				Do not exit program on empty info file when printing syntax.
	* share/doc/gmt/*:	All moved to doc/*

2011-03-23	jluis
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Do not test if file exist for files imported via GDAL and
				that are located elsewhere on the Web (name starting by 'http').
				With this we can import files directly via their URL
	* gmtapi_util.c:	---"---

2011-03-22	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		Fixed erroneous way of scanning symbol option -Sm
	* gmt_plot.c:		Make sure PSL_* text/dimensions are set when plotting
				no annotation but still a plot title

2011-03-21	jluis
	* gmt_gdalread.h:	Add a new member to GDALREAD_CTRL struct to host the pointer
				to the pre-allocated grid array.
	* gmt_gdalread.c:	Use pre-allocated *grid array if it was transmitted. Note that
				in this case there is no test if pre-allocated mem is enough.
	* gmt_customio.c:	GMT_gdal_read_grd sends in the pre-allocated *grid array.

2011-03-21	pwessel
	* dbase/grdraster_func.c:	Better testing and return of errors.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Assign default pad in GMT_create_grid.

	* pstext_func.c:	Added -Gc to use text for setting up clipping only.
	* gmt_support.c:	Added +e to contlabel options to use text for setting up clipping only
				and delay plotting the text until psclip -Cs|c.  Affects grdcontour,

	* psclip_func.c:	Added -Cc|s to terminate text-based clip path and plot the text for
				either curved or straight text paths.
	* grdfft_func.c:	Let -E optionally use -G to set output file name [Default is stdout].
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Added GMT_init_complex to centralize setting of stride (1 or 2)

	  working GMT5 module in the repository.
	* pslib.c:		Changed versions of PSL_prologue/label.ps to match the
				new numbers after the merge back to the trunk.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-03-10	pwessel
	* GMT 4.5.6 finalized and released.  GMT cvs archive moved to GMT4.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-03-08	pwessel
	* configure.ac:		Check for bad 64-bit qsort under earlier OS X did not work.
				Needed to add -fno-common to CFLAGS under OS X Tiger
	* gmt2kml_func.c:	Segment headers now can have -T<text> options that are used for
				feature descriptions, but we will backwards honor the old -Dtext
				options.
	* gmt_init.c:		Will allow extended columns D (distance), G (fill), L (label),
				T (text), W (pen) and Z( value) to be used in -a<col>=<name>.

2011-03-07	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		The -a parsing now allows +G (upper case) for geometry, which means
				we must split features that straddles the Dateline since the G in
				GIS apparently does not mean what we think it means...
	* gmtconvert_func.c:	Did not copy over segment headers, labels, and ogr info.
	* gmt_map.c:		Added GMT_split_dateline_poly which splits a polygon that straddles
				the Dateline into TWO pieces (some pieces connected by non-area bridges)
	* gmt_support.c:	Added GMT_split_dateline_line which splits a line that straddles
				the Dateline into several individual segments.

				 Also: -Z...s... now properly skips number of bytes, not items.

2011-03-02	pwessel
	* CPTs:			Added "random" as valid cpt file; this will generate
				random colors instead of interpolating from a master table.
	* gmt_plot.c:		Added GMT_geo_polygon_segment which extends GMT_geo_polygon
				to handle filling and outline in the polar cap cases.  Used
				by psxy_func.c.
	* gmt_init.c:		Let -a also imply -fg

				SEMI-axes (docs said major/minor but code did semi.)

2011-02-22	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		The symbol_parsing for psxy[z] did not properly set the
				column types when no symbol size was given.  This affected
				symbols that require angles (-Sw, -SE, -SJ) when unit was SI.

2011-02-21	pwessel
	* grdimage_func.c:	Wasted time resampling image when -JQ was used (is linear).
	* gmt_project.h:	Added macro GMT_IS_NONLINEAR_GRATICULE which returns true
				when parallels/meridians are not orthogonal or nonlinear.
				Used in grdimage to determine if resampling is needed.

2011-02-20	pwessel
	* grdmask_func.c:	New option -Ni|I|p|P to set inside of polygons to the polygon IDs.
				These may come from OGR aspatial values, segment head -L<ID>,
				or a running number, starting at a specified origin [0].
				Now correctly handles polygons with perimeters and holes.

2011-02-18	pwessel
	* gmt_version.h.in	Added macro GMT_MP which will appear in usage messages to indicate
				if a module has multi-processor support ([API] vs [API-MP]).
	* grid registration:	Now given new common option -r which replaces mostly -F and
				is backwards compatible in compat mode.

2011-02-17	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		-: Option flipped column type, which it should not have done!

2011-02-16	remko
	* *.c, *.txt, gmtdefaults.in:	Replaced .gmtdefaults and gmtdefaults.conf by gmt.conf

	* pslib.*:		Got rid of n_copies argument in PSL_setdefaults

2011-02-15	remko
	* configure.ac, config.mk, Makefile:	Smarter way of specifying -O or -g when using --enable-debug
				or not. Use dsymutil on Mac when setting --enable-debug. Thanks to
				Florian Wobbe.

2011-02-15	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		multi_segments[GMT_OUT] defaults to FALSE but becomes TRUE if a

	* grdtrack_func.c:	The -C option can now work with Cartesian data (assumes x = y in
				terms of units).

2011-02-08	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		Replaced GMT_getparameter by GMT_putparameter, avoiding requirement to
				set size of "value" accurately.
				Complete rewrite of GMT_savedefaults, using GMT_putparameter to
				avoid code duplication. Output now follows layout of gmtdefaults.conf.

2011-02-05	pwessel
	* blockmean_func.c:	Now use -Ss for block sums [-Sz remains under GMT_COMPAT].
				Added -Sn to explicitly count the number of points per block.
				[It will now ignore any weights read].

2011-02-03	pwessel
	* filter1d_func.c:	Did not reset F.n_rows = 0 for each segment
				Improved parsing of -N w/wo GMT_COMPAT set
	* mapproject_func.c:	Did not reset cumulative distance for new segments (only for gaps)

2011-01-27	pwessel
	* grdpaste_func.c:	Need to pass original headers and instead manipulate data pointer.
	* configure.ac:		Added --enable-openmp to utilize openMP with GCC.

2011-01-25	jluis
	* grdfilter_func.c	Implemented OpenMP parallelization after GMT4 code provided
				by Dan Kokron. Modifications are #ifdefed and will be used
				only if GMT is compiled with OpenMP.

2011-01-25	remko
	* makecpt_func.c:	Make dz in -T optional. If omitted, keep same number of colors.
	* makecpt.txt:		---"---

2011-01-25	pwessel

2011-01-17	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_init_func.c:	Did not write both or -Nd -Ns to the tag file.

2011-01-16	remko
	* GMT_pstext_justify.sh:	Put nodes in the proper places (not the same as box)

2011-01-11	remko
	* src/pslib.c:		Improved proportioning of textbox. Replaced 'exch def' by 'edef'
	* PSL_prologue.ps:	Introduced /edef. Replaced 'exch def' by 'edef'

2011-01-09	pwessel
	* triangulate_func.c:	Did not use projected coordinates when -R -J was given.

2011-01-09	remko
	* doc/GNUmakefile:	Use tex4ht instead of latex2html. This allows/requires
				creating PNG files of the images ourselves.

2011-01-08	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		Let -U timestamp use FONT_LOGO [Helvetica] instead of being
				hardwired to use Helvetica.
				Use line-cap SQUARE for rectangular, plain map frames.
	* pstext_func.c:	New option -Ql|u to change the case of all text to lower
				or upper case [Default leaves text alone].
	* Example 31:		Added, thanks to Florian Wobbe.  Shows how to use non-standard
				fonts in a GMT plot via CUSTOM_font_info.d.

2011-01-04	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_cspline should initialize c[0] = c[n-1] = 0.0 in case
				it is called repeatedly [not the case in GMT].
2011-01-03	pwessel
	* grdproject_func.c:	The -N is now obsolete (backwards compatible as in grdsample)
				since -D can set nx/ny if requested.
	* autoconf.ac:		Moving to use GSHHS 2.1.1 for next release.
	* gmt_shore.c:		---"---

2010-12-31	pwessel
	* x2sys_init_func.c:	Crashed if -D was not given [should imply -DTAG].

2010-12-29	pwessel
	* psscale_func.c:	Now patterns have constant orientation regardless of using
				horizontal or vertical bar.

2010-12-22	jluis
	* mex/mapproject.c:	Works, but not with all advertised output options.
	* mex/grd2grd.c:	Template program to build all MEXs that take one grid
				in input and create one grid in output (e.g. grdclip)
	* mex/compile_mex.bat:	Update to build MEXs that use the grd2grd.c template.

2010-12-21	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		GMT_extract_label had a few bugs; now gets the label OK.

2010-12-20	remko
	* utilmeca.c:		Patch to fix incorrect plotting of moment tensors with big
				isotropic components. Thanks to Jeremy Pesicek.

	* *.c:			Added more warnings when GMT_COMPAT options are used.
	* grd2rgb*:		Renamed from gmt2rgb*
	* gmt_support.c:	When calculating how far to place an annotation from the tick mark
				we must check if a fancy frame width exceeds the tick length.

2010-12-13	pwessel
	* project_func.c:	The -Dg|d is made obsolete (under GMT_COMPAT) but did not work
				anyway since output is entirely controlled by FORMAT_GEO_OUT.
	* pswiggle_func.c:	The gap -D is made obsolete (under GMT_COMPAT) as that functionality
				is provided by the universal -g option.
	* pshistogram_func.c:	The -T<col> option is made obsolete (under GMT_COMPAT) as we
				now have the universal -i<col> option.

2010-12-13	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		For some reason -W was not forcing -A. Now it does it again

2010-12-12	jluis
	* gmt_gdalread.ch:	Added a new struct in output that holds metadata info per each band.
				Namely the scale/offset factors.
	* gmt_customio.c:	When reading from GDAL apply scale/offset in case they differ to 1/0
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Add mechanism to allow request a SUBDATASET (GDAL parlance) via GDAL
	* ps2raster_func.c:	Added optional margins to -A.

2010-12-12	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Let GMT_grd_init also set the default pad.

2010-12-11	pwessel
	* pslegend_func.c:	Need to keep the original -R around since it may be -R....r
				If -Dx is used then -R -J are not needed for overlays.
	* gmt_init.c:		The -R parsing must reset common.R.oblique if not ...r
	* grdedit_func.c:	Several basic bugs from porting now fixed.
	* gmt_map.c:		For van Grinten: errors in left/right_cirle

2010-12-11	jluis
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Increase the size of the string array in GMT_grd_get_units() to
				avoid 'Buffer overrun' that occurred with long description strings

2010-12-05	pwessel
	* spotter/grdrotater_func.c:	Did not handle the rotation of an entire global grid since

2010-12-02	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys.c:	Minor bug in x2sys binary reading of floats

2010-11-30	pwessel

2010-11-27	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		Implemented custom and/or irregular annotations.
	* gmt_support.c:	Implemented custom and/or irregular annotations.
	* -B:			Can now take -Bc<intfile>, for manual control
				of placement of annotations/ticks/gridlines as
				well as overriding the annotation with a text label.

2010-11-25	pwessel
	* share/doc/gmt/examples/Makefile:
	* doc/scripts/GMT_RGBchart.sh:
	* configure.ac:
	* doc/scripts/functions.sh:
	* Misc *.c:		Applied patches from Florian Wobbe fixing minor scripting
				omissions and a few dozen warnings.

2010-11-23	pwessel
	* grdmask_func.c:	Must skip "polygons" with less than 3 points.  Also, the
				resampling distance for spherical data was wrong, now 0.1 degrees.

2010-11-21	pwessel
	* psscale_func.c:	Added option -T to place a rectangle behind the scale.

2010-11-19	jluis
	* gmt_esri_io.c:	Replaced call to GMT_fscanf by plain fscanf because with first
				it was failing to read the datastream on Windows.
				Added float output ESRI format (ef) and renamed int format (ei).
	* xyz2grd_func.c:	Replaced call to GMT_fscanf by plain fscanf
	* gmt_io.c:		Same

2010-11-19	pwessel
	* gmtselect_func.c:	Due to resampling of parallels in -N, some points exactly on
				a coast bin parallel could fail the test due to roundoff.
				Fixed by not resampling coastlines since it is a Cartesian test.
				Added -Efn to change how boundary points are treated [Default
				considers them to be inside].  Place the old -N...[o] under
				GMT_COMPAT check.
	* grdlandmask_func.c:	Same.

2010-11-18	pwessel
	* gmt_esri_io.c:	Must look for both nodata_value and NODATA_value, apparently.
	* xyz2grd_func.c:	Failed if -Evalue was given and the ESRI grid already had a
				nodata_value line.  Now will process this line, if present.
				The value given on the command line will override any setting
				found in the file. [Note: -E is only available in GMT_COMPAT mode].
				Also made string-checks case-insensitive.
	* gmt_map.c:		We have a safety valve for preventing a painful slow search
				around the map perimeter.  The search is appropriate for maps
				but not for mapproject results.  The limit was for 200 inch
				wide maps == 14400p.  A user ran pscoast with 14401p and was
				caught.  Now check for 400 inch and also check if PSL has
				been initiated. If not then it is probably a projection job.
	* gmtselect_func.c:	Need to pass GMT_IO_ASCII model to GMT_Get_Data to ensure
				the -C, -F, -L files are read as ASCII regardless of what
				the input data source is.
	* gmt_io.c:		When ASCII mode, need to save/restore any netcdf i/o settings.
	* gmtapi_util.c:	Check if GMT_IO_ASCII is present in the mode flag.
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_inonout_sphpol_count failed to detect crossings if a
				polygon had vertical line-segments with same longitude as
				the point we were testing.

2010-11-17	pwessel
	* gmtdp_func.c:		Now properly deals with units for geographic calculations
				and no units for Cartesian.
	* grdmath_func.c:	Now, LDIST and PDIST, like SDIST, returns distances in degrees
				if -fg; otherwise Cartesian.  use new operator DEG2KM to
				convert spherical degrees to km.

2010-11-15	pwessel
	* grdtrack_func.c:	New options -Clength/dx[/spacing] to automatically create
				cross-profiles normal to the given line segments.  Also
				given -Am|p to affect resampling of paths, and -D<dfile>
				to save the resampled original line (with dist/az appended).
	* grdproject_func.c:	Now assign proper x/y units.
	* grdsample_func.c:	Did not use -R value when given.
	* imgsrc/img2grd_func.c:	Many bug fixes. Now works.
	* gmtapi_utils.c:	Write grid to memory forgot to set pointer.
	* gmt_vector.c:		GMT_fix_up_path in -Ap|m mode might duplicate the start point.

2010-11-14	pwessel
	* project_func.c:	Did not use IO_COL_SEPARATOR when writing mixed mode output.
	* grdtrack_func.c:	Did not use IO_COL_SEPARATOR when writing mixed mode output.
				Can now handle any number of -Gingrds and will sample them
				all in the order given.

2010-11-13	jluis
	* gmtinstall|suppl.bat: Build Windows binaries in GMT_COMPAT mode. We will revert
				this sometime in a not too distant future.

2010-11-11	pwessel
	* filter1d_func.c:	Changed -Nncols/tcol to just -Ntcol since we are reading
				in the file and thus know the number of columns.  Allow
				for backwards compatibility (skip the users ncols).
	* sample1d_func.c:	Did not have -A[m|p] option.

2010-11-10	pwessel
	* nearneighbor_func.c:	Changed default to a more reasonable -N4/2.
				Fixed issues with distances and i/o (double close file)

2010-11-05	jluis
	* meca/utilmeca.c:	Fix bug affecting the plot of P & T axis
	* meca/psmeca_func.c:	Fix a few issues in -a option.
				T_axes marker was white instead of black.

2010-11-08	jluis
	* gmt_plot.c:		Wrap the fp assignement in GMT_plotinit with a #ifdef WIN32
				to avoid another cross DLL issue.

				mean "use 10 points to compute average angle" but the syntax
				now is -Gd2i[/<frac>], where <frac> can be changed from 0.25
				which is how quickly the first label is plotted.

2009-11-20	remko
	* pslib.c, PSL_prologue.ps:	"os" is now either "P S" or "N", thus changing all
				"P fs os" to "fs os". Fill automatically closes path, so no
				"P" needed before that. Also ensure init of "fs" and "os".

2009-11-20	pwessel

	* gmt_plot.c:		Implemented new PSL_command.

2009-10-23	pwessel
	* pslib.[ch]:		Functions are now called PSL_* and take a PSL_CTRL pointer as
				their first argument.
2009-10-23	remko
	* config.mk.in, common.mk: Replaced makegmt.macros by config.mk
				Replaced gmtalldeps.macros by common.mk
	* All makefiles:	Improved handling of libs in Makefiles

2009-10-21	remko
	* src/GNUmakefile, src/Makefile, gmtprogram.c: make_program.sh replaced by gmtprogram.c,
				which accomplishes the same without creating intermediate
				source files.
				This made *_cmd functions and gmtapi_cmd.c superfluous (still
				included though).
	* gmt_customio.c, gmt_grdio.c:	Make sure GMT_memory always has sizeof() argument.
	* gmt_support.c, *.c:	New convenience macros for memory allocation:
				GMT_memory for GMT_memory_func, GMT_malloc for GMT_malloc_func
				which used to be called GMT_alloc_memory, GMT_free for GMT_free_func.
	* GMT_memory.sed:	Sed script to change the code for the new convenience macros.

2009-10-20	remko
	* configure.ac:		Compatibility version is 5.0.0 not 4.0.0.

	* gmt_init.c:		Replaced GMT_default_error function with a macro.
	* gmt_io.c:		Fixed bug in GMT_traverse_dir.
	* gmt_map.c:		Initialize the uninitialized.
	* gmt_support.[ch]:	Changed GMT_alloc_memory[234] from function to macro.
	* gmt_error.h:		New GMT_message, GMT_report and GMT_default_error macros.
	* *.c:			Use GMT_message and GMT_report where appropriate.
	* explain_-V.txt:	Add multiple levels.

2009-10-17      pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		verbose is now integer from 0-4, with default 1 which
				is fatal errors.  -V equals 2, -V<level> now accepted.
				Implemented Remko's idea of GMT_message macro with
				variable arguments to print variables if needed.

2009-10-16      pwessel
	* Moved gmt5 stuff into src, changed library names to gmtcore, gmtcoreps, and
	  gmtapi, added make_gmtapi.sh which creates gmtapi_cmd.[ch] and gmtapi_func.h.
	  All makefiles are now called Makefile (uppercase M).
	* gmt_init.c:		GMT_parse_common_options no longer takes the w,e,s,n pointers
	* Makefile:		Only does libraries and blockmean, psbasemap for now.  We
				will add programs as they are converted.

2009-10-15      pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Now use .gmtdefaults and check for GMT 5 version.  Also
				use .gmtcommands, and no longer check for backwards
				compatibility with GMT 3 defaults.
	* x2sys.c:              x2sys_pick_fields should NOT reset x_col, y_col, t_col as
	                        these indicate which input columns hold x, y, t.
	* x2sys/x2sys_datalist.c:       Confusion between input order and output order when
	                        the -F<list> option was used.

2009-10-15	jluis
	* gmt_customio.c:	Fixed bug resulting from releasing the pointer to from_gdalread
				structure before its members.
	* gmt_gdalread.c:	Force computation of min/max since metadata info may be wrong

2009-10-14	pwessel
	* src/gmt5:		Can now build psbasemap application!

2009-10-14	remko
	* grdtrend.c:	Explicitly set pstuff[0] = 1 and use it in loops.
			Ported from grdtrend.c:1.36.

2009-10-12	pwessel
	* Passes the tests.
	* gmtwhich.c:	New program that reports the full path to
	  		data files by searching the GMT_DATADIR paths.

2009-10-08	pwessel
	* Now completes test suite as before except for psmeca test.
	* All supplements now compile but not tested for run-time yet.

2009-10-07	pwessel
	* Running the 29 examples now works.  No work on supplements yet except
	  sed changes.  Many test script also fail at this stage.

2009-10-05	pwessel
	* Introduced gmt_prototypes.h for all API low-level functions
	  The libraries now all use pointers to pass the GMT "globals"
	  and they are compiling. All progs are compile, link.

2009-10-03	pwessel
	* Introduce several new include files by breaking up gmt.h:
		gmt_crossing.h gmt_hash.h gmt_texture.h gmt_ps.h
		gmt_defaults.h gmt_macros.h gmt_time.h gmt_types.h
		gmt_debug.h gmt_constants.h gmt5.h
	* Replaced all global variables, now passed via stucture GMT.
	  Currently the only remaining global.  All compiles now.

2009-10-03	pwessel		GMT 5 branch tag set: GMT5_branch

2009-10-01	pwessel
	* psrose.c:		Needed to set scale to 1 so the bounding box
				calculations would be correct for EPS output.

2009-10-01	remko
	* explain_-J*.txt:	Added necessary / after -Jpoly
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	Removed rogue \n before </coordinates>\n.

2009-09-29	pwessel

				was meant to be $enable_gdal, and a bad if-test.

2009-09-28	jluis
	* x2sys/x2sys_merge.c:	Improved updating algorithm for detected cases where
				where it was failing badly.

2009-09-27	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Bug in the parsing of -Jg<lon>/<lat>/<radius>/<lat>.
	* spotter/backtracker.c:	When -L is set, -mo must be turned on automatically
					even if -m is not set.

2009-09-25	pwessel
	* gmtconvert.c:		The -S option failed for actual matches; the 2009/5/26
				change screwed that up.  Now fixed and tested.
	* spotter/rotconverter.c:	New option -E to reduce stage pole opening
					angles by <fact> [0.5] (to get half-spreading rates)

2009-09-24	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		GMT_read_img did not apply swab if little-endian arch.

2009-09-24	remko
	* configure.ac:		Fixed bug with -rpath

2009-09-22	pwessel
	* misc/kml2gmt.c:		Attempt to parse feature description (if present in KML)
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:		Attempt to write feature description (if present in segment header)
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:		SEGV when an array index was allowed to become -1

2009-09-20	pwessel
	* GMT 4.5.1 finalized and released
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-09-19	pwessel
	* psxy.c:		Added 4 new custom symbols (90-degree triangle in 4 quadrants)

2009-09-17	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_get.c:	The -L option failed if list contained file extensions
2009-09-15	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_solve.c:	Did not allocate array for weights.
	* pswiggle.c:		Incorrectly computed distances with -Jx<scale>d.

2009-09-13	pwessel
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	Avoid mixing stdout/GMT_stdout as Windoze is Windoze.
	* misc/kml2gmt.c:	Avoid mixing stdout/GMT_stdout as Windoze is Windoze.

2009-09-12	pwessel
	* spotter:		Failed in 64-bit mode due to variable mismatch:
	* spotter/backtracker.c:	Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs
	* spotter/hotspotter.c:		Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs
	* spotter/originator.c:		Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs

2009-09-11	remko
	* gmtdefaults_*.in:	Enter TRANSPARENCY = 0; replaced color triplets by names.
	* gmt_init.c:		Let gmtdefaults output TRANSPARENCY and print colors as names
				if available.
	* gmt_support.c:	Added GMT_getrgb_index to get index of preset RGB triplets.
	* gmt_{init,map.c}:	When using -JX, give width or height as 0 and it will adjust to
				the scale of the other (keeping aspect ratio).

2009-09-10	pwessel
	* grdcontour.c:		The -L option was not used in limiting contours.

2009-09-10	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		Introduced option to make material transparent using the
				--TRANSPARENCY setting (or gmtset TRANSPARENCY). Can be viewed
				with Adobe Distiller (only?).
	* gmt_plot.c, gmtdefaults.txt, gmt.h, gmt_globals.h, gmt_keywords.d:	---"---
	* psclip.c, pscoast.c:	Replaced booleans GMT_ps.clip_on and GMT_ps.clip_off with single
				GMT_ps.clip with values -1, 0 or +1.
	* configure.ac, all makefiles:	Needed to redo the way GDAL_INC and GDAL_LIB are inserted.
				-I (without anything) of -L (without anything) when GDAL is not
				enabled makes compiling impossible. So *_LIB and *_INC (also
				NETCDF) now include the -I and -L/-l flags.

2009-09-10	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	It now lets the Core field be computed with the IGRF and added
				to the atmospheric sources calculated with CM4. We added
				this because the secular variation in CM4 is limited to 2002.5
				but the "atmospheric coefficients" can be continuously updated

2009-09-09	pwessel
	* LICENSE.TXT:		Replaced file COPYING with LICENSE.TXT and clarified we are
	  			using GPL v2 as displayed in all source files.
	* GSHHS*:		Updated to GSHHS 2.0.1 so new pscoast options can work
	* configure.ac:		Added --enable-gdal[=dir] for experimental GDAL grid import
				functionality for reading GDAL-supported grids (one band) and
				plotting of geotiff via grdimage

2009-09-08	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	Got wrong time as time initialization had changed but
				not implemented in this program.
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	-T did not handle spaces in titles and folder names

2009-09-07	jluis
	* gmt_customio.[ch]:	Added the optional GDAL interface as format 22
	* gmtinstall.bat:	Now has rules to optionally compile the GDAL interface

2009-09-07	remko
	* minmax.c:		Bug fix: -EH did not work

2009-09-06	pwessel
	* gmt_customio.c:	Made surfer grid header i/o 64-bit compliant

2009-09-06	jluis
	* nc2xy.c:		Added -b option (of which only -bo makes sense)

2009-09-06	remko
	* configure.ac:		Now use --enable-flock to enable file locking, instead of
				--disable-flock to disable if.
				Use --enable-64 to force 64-bit compilation, use --disable-64
				to force 32-bit compilation. Otherwise use default.
				Switch -DGMT_QSORT on only for OSX prior to Snow Leopard.

2009-09-04	pwessel
	* gmt.h:		Now has GMT_abs macro that handles abs/labs use

2009-09-04	remko
	* gmt_map.[ch]:		Changed GMT_truncate from being a pointer function (PFL)
				to a regular function that simply calls GMT_truncate_x
				or GMT_truncate_tm depending on whether projection is TM.
				This to avoid problems with calling GMT_truncate with
				constant argument -1 in 64-bit machines.
	* gmt_shore.c, psmask.c, gmt.h, gmt_globals.h:	---"---
	* pscoast.c:		Added mention of debugging options when DEBUG is on.
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_log_array: Recoded to avoid 64-bit error (last value was not
				included).
				GMT_pow_array, GMT_log_array: Simplified code.
				GMT_memory: Now free memory when reallocating memory with size 0.

2009-08-27	jluis
	* gmt_gdalread.[ch]:	Wrapper function to interface with the GDAL library
	* grdimage.c:		Modified (with #ifdefs) to allow minimalist images import
				using GDAL, via the gmt_gdalread function.
	* gmt_support.c:	Fixed bug in x_inc adjust. It was cosd (0.5 * (h->x_min + h->x_max))
				Instead of cosd (0.5 * (h->y_min + h->y_max))

2009-08-20	remko
	* pslib.c, pslib_inc.h:	ps_place_color now also adds the "set...color" operator, so
				that PSL->internal.paint_code could be removed.

2009-08-17	remko
	* gmt_plot.c, GMT_Chapter_{3,6}.tex:	Documentation on -JPoly added.
	* gmt_map.c:		Made frame and annotation of polyconic work properly.
	* {x2sys,mgd77,mgg}/makefile:	Solved problems with install/uninstall and missing *.h
				files in distro.

2009-08-15	remko
	* gmt_proj.[ch], gmt_map.c, gmt_init.c:	First stab at introducing polyconic projection.
				Not documented yet, but seems to work (-JPoly).

2009-07-24	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	The routine that checks if a points is inside or outside a
				polar cap had trouble when the points longitude exactly
				equalled a point on the polygon since round-off would
				cause our test to fail.  Now hopefully fool-proof.
2009-07-23	pwessel
	* psmask.c:		With -D, the internal di,dj constant was set way too large.

2009-07-22	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.[ch]:	The -A+r|+l option was premature as more info in the GSHHS
				netcdf files are needed to properly skip features.  GSHHS 2.0.1
				will have this information so pscoast et al need to check
				for versions before attempting to use any of the +<modifiers>

2009-07-18	mtchandl
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Bug in -I option; needed to set bitpattern for bad faa.

2009-07-18	remko
	* pslib.c, pslib_inc.h:		Added option to reduce all color to gray scale.
	* gmt_init.c, gmtdefaults.txt:	Added setting PS_COLOR = gray.

2009-07-15	pwessel
	* grdmask.c:		Free some memory that was ignored.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2009-07-15
	* GMT 4.5.0 finalized and released
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-07-13	pwessel
	* surface.c:		When data lie exactly on a plane and -L was used, surface tried to free memory
				for constraints that never needed to be allocated.
2009-07-10	pwessel
	* gmt_suppl.html:	Add all the new supplement programs to the HTML doc page.
	* *.c:			Handle error codes so as to not raise the wrath of Ubuntu

2009-07-10	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		GMT_font_lookup now understands font numbers too.
	* psscale.c:		Added -Aa and -Al options to move only the annotations or label to the
				other side of the color bar. When using -A on horizontal bar, the last
				tick mark would not appear. Require -Ac to keep the column plotting
				of vertical labels.
	* pslegend.c:		Make font height dependent on actual font used.

2009-07-09	pwessel
	* gmt_mgg_header2.c:	Can now handle float grids, and properly handles byte-order swapping in input.
	* segyprogs/pssegy.c:	Casting as long forced 8 rather than 4-byte offsets. Thanx to Adrian Benson.
	* segyprogs/pssegyz.c:	Casting as long forced 8 rather than 4-byte offsets.
	* segyprogs/segy2grd.c:	Casting as long forced 8 rather than 4-byte offsets.

2009-07-09	remko
	* psclip.c:		Produce warning when using -B in combination with -N or -T.
				Better reuse of code.
	* psclip.txt:		Explained even-odd rule.
	* psxy.{c,txt}:		Added -T option. Equivalent to adding /dev/null (or NUL on Windows).
	* pslegend.c, anim01.sh:	Make use of new psxy -T option.

2009-07-08	pwessel
	* sph/sphtriangulate.c:	Must turn -mo on when -T is selected.

2009-07-08	remko
	* psscale.c:		When using -A on vertical scale bar, annotation was left not right aligned.

2009-07-07	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		The polar cap on gridlines needed to be reversed for r-theta (polar) maps

2009-07-07	remko
	* gmt_support.c (GMT_RI_prepare):	Fixed bug: when x_inc in km, m, etc,
				value was ignored (always 1).

2009-07-05	pwessel
	* grdimage.c:		For -Q we now make sure the NaN-color is unique.

2009-07-04	jluis
	* gmtsuppl.bat:		Add x2sys_list x2sys_report x2sys_solve & x2sys_merge to the x2sys section

2009-07-02	remko
	* Ellipsoids.txt:	Added TOPEX ellipsoid

2009-07-01	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Did not reset the E77 structure between cruises.
	* mgd77/mgd77list.c:	Modifier -At added which attempts to create fake cruise times
				based on header information and distance along track.

2009-06-30	pwessel
	* grdfilter.c:		Toggle -T was not processed correctly if -Rgridfile was given.
	* mgd77list.c:		Output relative time did not use GMT's --TIME_*

2009-06-27	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_history):	No longer remove supposedly empty .gmtcommands4 file.
				Could have been written to by piped GMT command. Now create/write
				only when new matter is to be written.

2009-06-25	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Change for reasonable x/y range if units has the words "longitude"
				or "latitude" before concluding we have geodetic coordinates.
	* gmt_support.c:	The modifier :<radius>[unit] to the -G option in grdcontour for
				the placement of contour labels is now +r<radius>[unit] since the
				colon interfered with ddd:mm:ss coordinates.

2009-06-24	jluis
	* x2sys/x2sys_merge.c:	New program to merge updated COEs table into a main COE table database
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Do not use any GMT_XXX to access ascii files on creation/writing so that
				it can work on Windows as well (improvement on 2009-06-07 changes).

2009-06-24	pwessel
	* ps2raster.c:		Exceeded memory allocation for out_file.  Now in static memory.

2009-06-24	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		Do not crash if a name with extension is given to -F (rip the extension)

2009-06-23	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	-AE will ignore the verification status and process e77 anyway.
	* mgd77/mgd77path.c:	Added -P- to just list the IDs and not the full paths

2009-06-21	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	Given -I601+/601+ the y_inc was not treated correctly

2009-06-20	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.c:		Added support for the +p<percent> modifier to limit features whose
				area is less the <percent> of the corresponding full-resolution polygon

2009-06-19	pwessel
	* gmt_globals.h:	Change default ascii format to %.12g to avoid loss of precision.
				Changed default for OUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT to D (-180/180) so it
				is the same as that for PLOT_DEGREE_FORMAT.
2009-06-18	pwessel
	* misc/gmtconnect.c:	Enhanced -T option to eliminate connections when the 2nd closest
				pair is too close.  Also added -C option to simply separate the
				open from the closed polygons (no connecting).

2009-06-17	pwessel
	* grdfft.c:		Now also has Butterworth band-pass filter.

2009-06-17	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_begin):	GMT_history should come AFTER reading defaults, otherwise
				there is no way to switch it off.
	* gmt2kml.c:		Option -R becomes -Ra (otherwise takes it from .gmtcommands4).
				Default folder name now "%s Features", where %s is feature type.
				No longer produces empty segments (when all data out of bounds).
				Create folder per input file (except standard input).
				Ignore -C option when plotting lines or polygons.
	* gmt2kml.txt:		Added example of document hierarchy.

2009-06-16	pwessel
	* gmt2kml.{c,txt}:	-T now takes title and optionally folder name.  When -O or -K is used
				we always group features into folders and each folder has their own
				style settings.

2009-06-16	remko
	* gmtmath.c:		Fixed bug: tried to free memory that was not allocated.
	* gmt_io.c:		Allow specifying both -mi and -mo.
	* gmt2kml.{c,txt}:	Removed altitude argument of -E (had no purpose). Set default pen to 1,
				as specified.  Changed -AA to -Aa, inline with -Ag and -As.
				Altitude argument of -A becomes default altitude.  Fixed error with -Gn.
				Always write linestyle and polygon style (need for extrusion).
				Moved <extrude> and <altitudeMode> within <feature></feature>.
				Write out <gx:altitudeMode> when required.
				Removed -AG, -AS; use -Ag0, -As0 instead. Allow vertical scaling.
				Removed -F<capital>, altitude mode is now fully controlled by -A.
				Put set of points in a folder automatically.
				Label line segments automatically.  Improved documentation.
				Renamed option -L to -R, which now also performs data screening.
				Renamed option -C to -L. Added -C option to color icons by value.
				Added option to scale altitude values.
				Made to work with binary and netCDF files.

2009-06-15	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Allow negative integer interval (-n) for annotating log axis; this means
				annotate every n'th power of 10.
	* misc/gmtconnect.c:	Now honors -V properly.

2009-06-11	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		No longer write node_offset = 0 to file (not essential, only confusing).
	* gmt_grdio.c:		GMT_grd_setregion now includes "interpolant" argument: this ensures
				enough padding (if available) from the input grid and no blank edges
				on left and/or right side of the map.
				More appropriate coding of GMT_grd_shift.
				GMT_adjust_loose_wesn now includes test on data domain (moved from main
				programs calling it).
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_RI_prepare recoded. Possibly safer. Need to investigate if it can
				be skipped when nx and ny already set.
	* grd2xyz.c:		Area check moved to GMT_adjust_loose_wesn.
	* grdvector.c, grdrotater.c, grdview.c, grdcontour.c, grdimage.c:
				Extra argument in GMT_grd_setregion. No more subset checks needed.

2009-06-09	pwessel
	* misc/gmtdp.c:		With -m, did not write the correct multisegment header from input.

2009-06-07	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77info.c:	Use of both printf() and internal functions that write to GMT_stdout
				seams to be incompatible on Windows. Now always use fprintf (GMT_stdout, ...)
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Open ascii files with fopen (and not GMT_fopen) because they are written
				with fprintf(F->fp, ...) and Windows, again, gets lost.

2009-06-07	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Fixed bug in GMT_grd_setregion: longitudes were limited inward
				instead of outward. Caused white-space left and right in grdimage.

2009-06-03	pwessel
	* pscoast.c:		-C[l|r/]<fill> offers to paint river-lakes separately from lakes.
				The -A option can be used to exclude riverlakes or lakes for level 2.
				-W now allows different pens for the 4 levels of lines.
	* explain_gshhs.txt:	New include file for man pages for programs using GSHHS.
	* gmtselect.c:		Same upgrade to -A option as pscoast
	* grdlandmask.c:	Same upgrade to -A option as pscoast
	* gmt_init.c:		New function GMT_GSHHS_syntax to explain -A option for three programs.
	* gmt_shore.c:		Now looks for a version attribute in the GSHHS file that is reported
				when pscoast -Vl is used.  New treatment of riverlakes as special lakes.
	* gshhs/gshhs.*:	Header structure format for GSHHS 1.11 has changed to include two new
				integers: parent (the id of the containing polygon, or -1), and river
				(1 if a lake is a riverlake, 0 otherwise).
	* GSHHS*:		New version 1.11 that fixes the problem with permanent rivers introduced
				after GMT 4.2.0.  Also corrects gross errors near the mouth of the
				Amazon river.  GMT works with either GSHHS 1.11 or earlier but any
				option pertaining to riverlakes are ignored with older versions.
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Converting files from netCDF to MGD77 where time = NaN gave junk records.
	* misc/dimfilter.c:	New program for directional spatial filtering.

	* gmt_init.c:		Do not create empty .gmtcommands4 files

2009-05-28	remko
	* gmtselect.c:		Switches off just_copy_record when using netCDF I/O. Otherwise no
				output was produced. Unfortunately does not yet take into account
				that using -fit and -foT would require reformatting.

2009-05-27	pwessel
	* misc/gmtconnect.c:	Did not read standard input if no files were given.

2009-05-26	pwessel
	* gmtconvert.c:		With -S, did not report the number of output segments.  Now allows
				-S~<pattern> which reports segments whose header does NOT contain pattern.
				Should pattern actually start with ~ we escape it with \~pattern.

2009-05-25	pwessel
	* greenspline.c:	Calculation of nz layers was off by one, leaving out the
				penultimate layer.

2009-05-23	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	Now uses GMT_read_img to handle *.img files; earlier it could
				not handle the latest +-80 degree lats.  Also passed wrong filename variable.

2009-05-21	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		When only -mi is set there should be no multisegment headers on output
					but there was no if-test to check for that.

2009-05-21	remko

2009-05-14	remko
	* grdinfo.{c,txt}:	Add option -L0 to actually scan data to determine zmin and zmax
	* gmt_nc.c:		Argument [layer] was not stripped from varname and would end up
				in output grid.  Set zmin/zmax to NaN when info not in header.

2009-05-13	pwessel
	* *.[ch]:		Moving to use GMT_LONG for almost all integers.

2009-05-12	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_UTMzone_to_wesn):	Numerous bug fixes: Did not report bad zone
				for < A or > Z; Zones A+B reached till 84S instead of 80S; Zone J
				wrongly produced value for Zone K; Zones U+W were not recognized;
				Now also equates Zone O to Zone P (already equated Zone I to J).

2009-05-08	remko
	* gmtconvert.c:		Switch off default NaN treatment when NAN_RECORDS=pass and no
				multi-segment output is requested.
	* gmt_init.c:		Renamed GRID_FORMAT to GRIDFILE_FORMAT to avoid confusion with
				other GRID_* variables which relate to painting grids, and in
				accordance with GRIDFILE_SHORTHAND.
				GRID_FORMAT can still be used for backwards compatibility.
				Allow different units for font sizes. Default remains points.
				GMT_convert_units: add 10 to new_format to specify it as
				default unit as well.
	* gmt_keywords.d, gmt.h, gmt_grdio.h, gmt_globals.h, gmtdefaults.txt, gmtdefaults_??.in:
				Changed accordingly.

				Sutherland/Hodgman algorithm that handles curved boundaries.
	* gmt_io.c:		GMT_DATADIR can now be a list of directories, separated by colons
				or semi-colons (Windows).
	* mgd77list.c:		Used wrong time for IGRF calculation; worst case off by 1 year.
	* mgd77manage.c:	---"---

2009-05-06	pwessel
	* *.c, *.txt, *.tex:	While remaining backwards compatible, we no longer announce that

				document the user of GMT_DATADIR and GMT_USERDIR only.

2009-05-06	remko

				using the -E...+ mechanism when data were not geographic.

2009-04-29	remko
	* PSL_prologue.ps:	Changed "bind def" to "def" in function /FS. The "bind def" slowed

	* job*:			All examples now use -m
	* *.tex, *.man:		All documentation now use -m

2009-04-16	remko
	* psclip.c, pscoast.c:	Produce at least "S V" when clippath is empty.
	* gmt_plot.c (GMT_xyz_axis3D):	Bug fix: Call GMT_get_coordinate_label() with
				&GMT_plot_calclock instead of NULL. Crashed when using time labels
				in 3D plot.

2009-04-15	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		Add handling of -M|m by GMT_parse_common_options.
	* *.c:			Removed call to GMT_multisegment. -M|m now handled as common option.

2009-04-13	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_map_init_{albers,econic}):	Fixed inability to determine projection
				pole when central_meridian and western boundary are the same.

2009-04-11	remko
	* gmt.h, gmtmath.c, grdmath.c:	Added MOD function (remainder after floored division,
				Knuth style). This is in contrast to FMOD which gives the
				remainder after (horror) truncated division.
	* gmtmath.c:		For check if argument is file: remove suffix ?fields first.

2009-04-10	remko
	* Makefile, configure.ac, makegmt.macros.in:	Moved definition of SUPPL from Makefile

				Do not say "yes" to compilation when supplement not available.

2009-04-05	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:		The -D option would remove original attributes.  Now
				both original and revised attributes are carried in memory.
				This problem also affected mgd77convert -FC if used on a
				file after mgd77manage -D had been run.
2009-03-31	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_get_datum):	Reuse GMT_get_ellipsoid to capture <a>,<inv_f> format.

				else. Or leave them off altogether!

2009-03-24	pwessel
	* sph:			Introduce new GMT supplement sph which provide GMT-like
				front-ends for Robert Renka's Fortran SSRFPACK and STRIPACK
				libraries.  They are here translated to C via f2c and requires
				the f2c library and include file to compile and link.
				Tools include sphtriangulate (Delaunay and Voronoi spherical
				diagrams), sphdistance (spherical distances from lines to
				grid nodes using Voronoi partitioning), and spinterpolate

				boundaries.
	* gmt_init.c:		New Default setting NAN_RECORDS = skip|pass [skip].
				If "pass" we treat let the programs handle the NaNs; for some
				programs the NaNs in input record will act as indicators of
				data gaps for continuous lines.  If "skip" we report them
				as bad records.  In both cases the records are skipped.
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	Now honors NAN_RECORDS in tables given to -A.

2009-03-18	jluis

2009-03-05	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		Added -Wg to create a simple KML file for Google Earth.
				Recognize -Jx<scale> (e.g. no 'd') as a linear geographic
				projection when -R<region> fits inside a sane ([-180 360][-90 90])
				interval (when -W is used).

2009-03-04	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77list.c:	Now can specify -DA and -DB which, in the presence of time = NaN,
				will not output such records [-Da|b will].  Also clarified the
				ranges implied by -D/-S.
	* blockm*.c:		Gave bogus usage about number of input columns when -E is set
				but -E only affects output.  Input is always 3 or 4 cols.

2009-03-04	remko

				atand, atan2d as well as their "safe" equivalents.
	* coast/segment_connect.c:	Simplified i_great_circle_dist() by calling
				GMT_great_circle_dist().
	* gmt_map.c:		Fixed serious bug in GMT_az_backaz_flatearth: incorrectly
				converted degrees to radians. Fixed bug in GMT_get_rotate_pole:
				called GMT_rotate_pole_forward with radians instead of degrees.
				project_info.o_{beta,pole_lat,pole_lon} now in degrees.
				GMT_fix_up_path: all arithmetic now in degrees.
	* project.c:		Avoid changing variables in the control list (Ctrl);
				this may have been harmful in the future (GMT5).
				Removed "rads" argument from internal routines since it was
				always TRUE anyhow. All routines are now in degrees.
	* gmt_vector.[ch]:	GMT_geo_to_cart no longer alters the input coordinates.

2008-07-16	pwessel
	* grdblend.c:		A side-effect of the 2007-02-01 fix was that when the file
				is re-opened the row range is reset.  Now the possible
				offset is computed during initialization but applied when
				the file is finally opened for reading.
	* ps2raster.c:		Now will scan for the optional comment %%HiResBoundingBox
				which takes precedence over the values in %%BoundingBox.

2008-07-15	pwessel
	* pslib.*:		Now measure paper size in double precision points instead
				of truncating to nearest integer.  To remain backwards
				compatible for pslib users we now initialize all plotting

2008-06-01	pwessel
	* Win installer:	Now installs the GMT include files so users can build their own
				programs that use the GMT libs

2008-05-29	pwessel
	* grdreformat.c:	There is no longer a share/conf/gmt_formats.conf so the
				grdreformat usage message crashes. Introduced new file
				grdreformat.h created by GNUmakefile to include this info.

2008-05-27	pwessel
	* grdfilter.c:		The -D5 did not initialize xscale so filter search box was
				set to region width which typically is much larger.  The bug
				did not affect the results but unnecessarily increased runtime.
2008-05-27	remko
	* pslegend.c:		Let N (number of columns) also affect the printing of labels

2008-05-22	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c, gmt_init.c:	Added support for enhanced -E option for 3-D perspective

	* gmtselect.c:		Did not like a variable number of columns.  Now OK if ASCII
				i/o and at least 2 (3 with -Z) columns are found.
	* gmt_mgg2_header.c:	Passed 2nd, 3rd arguments to fread in the wrong order, thus
				failed to read GRD98 grids.
	* gmt_init.c:		Now, media size Custom_WxH can use W and H in inch, cm, or m
				by appending i, c, or m to each dimension.

2008-05-05	pwessel
	* psxyz.c:		Memory problem: Since realloc does not initialize we
				must explicitly set the pointer in the PSXYZ_DATA1 structure
				to NULL since we later use the pointer to determine if we
				need to free allocated memory.

				not checked for wrapping at a periodic map boundary.

2008-04-25	pwessel
	* x2sys:		Moved *.def to share/x2sys
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Cumulative fixes & updates since August 2007:
				Added -K option to flip navigation flags (if extreme positions
				cause checking to flag good records rather than bad).
				Added -D[x]r option, where x is any preexisting -D option.
				Appending r tells sniffer to use all records in sniffer output
				rather than omitting records flagged with bad navigation.
				Moved speed checking algorithm to precede any other analysis of
				mgd77 data records, including regression checking. This allows
				extreme nav errors to be flagged and ignored in later analysis.
				Modified speed checking algorithm to compare the current nav fix
				to the previous good nav fix, rather than just the previous nav fix.
				This does a better job of flagging the correct fix when excessive
				speeds are found. Previously the current flag was compared to the
				previous flag and whenever excessive speed was computed the current
				record was flagged. This lead to flagging good records at times when
				it was the previous record that was bad.
				Modified manage to accept flags with NaN time stamps.
				Changed speed check from speed > max_speed to fabs (speed) > max_speed
				Bug in E77 output causing distance to be printed when cruises have time stamps
				Track outliers in decimate function, if more than 5% outliers use the
				maximum possible MGD77 values for the 2D bin table in the decimate function.
				Blocked decimation algorithm when dumping values, gradients, etc., and when
				non-regression related warnings are selected (see -W option). Removed bug
				from excessive offset from grid print command.
				Fixed negative array index bug in precision check code
				Fixed an E77 RLS print bug
				Fixed memory deallocation bug - was GMT_free on out[rec] - now on out[curr]
				Added anomaly recalculation toggle to E77
				Use double instead of float for everything but the GMT grids
				Added anomaly sign tracking also fixed e77 scale and icept for A option
				also cleared up kludgy code in grid and ship regression section

2008-04-24	remko
	* ps2raster:		Use PID to augment the file names of temporary files.
				This is not totally secure, but the alternative, mkstemp, is not
				standard enough (not ISO C90).
				Option -N has become obsolete. Use -S and/or -Te instead.

2008-04-22	pwessel
	* psxy.c:		Now will properly clip polygon outline and not draw it along clipped border.
	* configure.ac:		Added support for --enable-mex-mdir=dir and --enable-mex-xdir=dir

	* mapproject.c:		-G+ will compute distance between coordinates in first 4 columns

2008-04-19	pwessel
	* configure.ac, src/makegmt.macros.in, mex/makefile:  Added support for --enable-octave
				as an alternative to --enable-matlab

2008-04-16	remko
	* psxy.c, psxyz.c:	Two bug fixes in both programs.
				- If first symbol in list with size was not circle, it got rejected.
				- When sizes of -Sr or -Sj were read from list, they were always inches.

2008-04-15	remko
	* pslib.c, PSL_*.ps:	Renamed a few PostScript commands; reduced prologues in size.
	* gmt_support.c (GMT_just_decode):	Bug fix: was defaulting to BC, instead of BL.
				Also reduced to two arguments (second being default justification).
	* ps{image,legend}.c:	Reduced arguments in GMT_just_decode.
	* ps{scale,text}.c:	---"---
	* gmt_support.h:	---"---
	* gmt_plot.[ch] (GMT_timestamp):	Added "justify" argument to specify justification of
				the time stamp box. Provided by gmtdefaults or -U option.
	* gmt_init.c:		Added justification to GMT_UNIX_POS. Is now <just>/<dx>/<dy>.

	* explain_-U.txt:	---"---
	* common_options.txt:	---"---
	* gmt{,_globals,_common.h}:	---"---

	* x2sys/x2sys_binlist.c:	Could create bad bins because of incorrect reallocation of memory.
	* mex/*.c:		No longer need to include matrix.h separately.  This helps octave compilation.

2008-04-09	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_timestamp):	Added new gmtdefaults value UNIX_TIME_FORMAT, which sets the format for
				the time string in the GMT time stamp (-U option). The default is
				"%Y %b %d %H:%M:%S", which is what was printed up to now, except that
				%e (which is not supported by ISO C90) is replaced by %d.
	* gmtdefaults.txt:	---"---
	* gmt{,_globals.h}:	---"---
	* gmtdefaults_*.orig:	---"---
	* gmt_plot.c:		Use gmtdefs.unix_time_format to format the time stamp. This also requires
				the time stamp box to size with the time string and the additional label
				to move. Tweaked the placement of the strings a bit (better vertical
				placement and relative horizontal placement using spaces).

2008-04-07	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Did not yet properly combine ?varname=suffix on output grid.
	* ps2raster.c:		Security improvements: (1) Replaced tmpnam by mktemp, as tmpnam provides
				a limited number of temp file names. (2) Run commands using system(cmd)
				directly and remove file using remove(file), instead of creating a
				script first.

2008-04-05	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Fixed final bug in GMT_radial_clip.  Also, GMT_world_map should be
				FALSE for azimuthal projections.  This fixes the -JA -JE pscoast bugs.

	* gmt_map.c, gmt_proj.c:	Fixed bug in azimuthal equal area projection that had the
				horizon shifted from where it ought to be.

2008-04-04	pwessel
	* gmt_stat.c:		Bug in GMT_median would sometime give subtle mistakes, most noticeable
				when only a few values were passed to the function. Traced to the use
				of size_t variables in expressions that should yield a negative value.

2008-04-04	remko
	* GNUmakefile:		Removed creation of *.tar.gz and GMT_src.zip.
	* configure.ac:		CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS as set by user is ADDED to anything configure

	* run_example_tests.sh:	New test script of example files
	* run_*_tests.sh:	Avoid excessive error messages when compare fails on missing files, etc.
	* ps2raster.c:		Always translate and/or rotate EPS output to origin. Not only when
				in concert with other formats. This makes -P -Te work as -P -Tef.

2008-04-02	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c: 		GMT_is_*_grid now works on header struct. GMT_grd_get_format also strips
				off ?<varname> and stores it in header->varname.
	* gmt_nc.c:		When writing netCDF grid ?<varname> can be used to assign variable name
				and long_name attribute.

2008-04-02	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		The radial clipping would sometimes add arcs using the arc that
				is > 180 degrees.
	* x2sys/x2sys_put.c:	Wrong test when replacing older track info lead to dbase loss.

2008-04-01	pwessel
	* examples/ex19/*:	Next GMT conference is now in 2009.

	* gmt_grdio.c:		Now the grd i/o support the GMT_[DATA|IMG|GRID]DIR environment settings.
	* grdinfo.c:		Reports actual path to the file (may change if GMT_GRIDDIR is involved).

2008-03-25	pwessel
	* pscontour.c:		Must deallocate *ind memory according to which function was used
	* triangulate.c:	Same.  Only affects Windows's insane memory management.

2008-03-24	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Added new rectangular clip function using Sutherland/Hodgman algorithm
				in order to fix incorrect results in grdlandmask.

				documentation.

2008-03-22	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		Moved GMT_nc_get_att_text to gmt_io.c so it can be used more generally.
	* gmt_io.c:		Implemented GMT_nc_input to support reading netCDF column data (tables).
				This also required changes to GMT_fopen and making GMT_fclose a real routine
				rather than a macro.
	* gmt_io.h, gmt_globals.h:	Changed accordingly.
	* misc/nc2xy.c:		More space for long_name and units.

2008-03-22	pwessel

				integers instead of 4-byte.

2008-03-19	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_map_clip_path):	In polar projection, step size for drawing clip path
				was wrong, resulting in missing wedge in donut shape.

2008-03-15	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_get_annot_label did not properly honor the ddd.xx setting
	* pstext.c:		In -D, if /dy is not given it is set equal to dx
	* psxy.c:		Same. Clarified both usage and man pages.

2008-03-13	remko
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_hsv_to_rgb, GMT_rgb_to_hsv, GMT_check_hsv now uses hsv[]
				instead of h, s, v, in accordance with similar routines.
				GMT_getrgb and GMT_gethsv can read hexadecimal color codes,
				which need to start with #, e.g. #ff0000 for red.

2008-03-11	pwessel
	* grdgradient.c:	With -D -S the slopes were not set to NaN if data were NaN

				A + in the gmtdefaults COLOR_MODEL definition overrules interpolation
				mode specified in cpt file.

2008-03-06	pwessel
	* binned_GSHHS*.cdf:	Added two missing barrier islands along Long Island, NY
				to the GSHHS database.  Updated next GSHHS version number to 1.10.

2008-02-27	remko
	* gmt_io.[ch], gmt_calclock.[ch]:	Removed GMT_dt_from_usert, GMT_usert_from_dt, GMT_dtime.
				These were remnants of a time that internal time representation was entirely
				in rata die numbers. Since computations are done extensively with relative
				time (in doubles) keeping the conversion double-to-double became non-sensical.

2008-02-25	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Now skips blank lines that has leading whitespace.  Function
				GMT_is_a_blank_line (char *line) is now used wherever ascii

				to TIME_UNIT and TIME_EPOCH set in .gmtdefaults.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Fixed 3 bugs in GMT_decode_grd_h_info that caused problems parsing -D
				option. Explicitly exclude = sign from becoming separator.

	* grd2xyz.txt, xyz2grd.txt:	Added information on using TIME COORDINATES.
	* gmt.h, gmt_globals.h:	Time system now fully defined in struct gmtdefs.time_system.
	* gmt_calclock.c:	---"---
	* gmt_init.c, gmt_init.h:	GMT_get_time_system and GMT_init_time_system_structure now use
				time_system as argument so that not only the internal time system
				defined in gmtdefs.time_system can be parsed.
				Need to move these functions to gmt_support.c?
				GMT_get_time_system can now also deal with "TIME_UNIT since TIME_EPOCH".
				'T' no longer required in epoch string.
				That means TIME_SYSTEM = "days since 2000-01-01 12:00" works.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Now reuses GMT_get_time_system and GMT_init_time_system_structure.

2008-02-24	pwessel
	* gmt_*.c:		Made sure functions call GMT_exit and not exit when quitting.  Only main

	* test/psscale/ages.sh:	Fixed errors in geological names. Put some bars upside down.
	* psscale.c:		Bug fixes: (1) Inverted vertical scale, when using filled rectangles:
				Colours remained in the original order. (2) Inverted vertical or horizontal
				scale, when using rectangles with gradients: Size of rectangles followed
				original order, not inverted. (3) In reverse mode, -Eb was plotting
				foreground triangle, -Ef background triangle.
	* doc/GMT_Appendix_M.tex, doc/scripts/GMT_App_M_2.sh:	Figure added to App M to illustrate uses
				of psscale.

2008-02-20	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		TIME_SYSTEM has become a shortcut for a combination of TIME_EPOCH and
				TIME_UNIT. When used, set gmtdefs.time_unit and gmtdefs.epoch immediately.
				No longer appears in .gmtdefaults4 file.  No more predefined scale,
				rata_die, etc for time systems. Those are determined from
				gmtdefs.time_{unit,epoch} by GMT_init_time_system_structure instead.
				Bug fix: 'c' for seconds was not recognized as TIME_UNIT (expected 's',
				which is kept for backwards compatibility).
	* gmt_time_systems.h:	Removed. Information merged into gmt_init.c.
	* gmt_calclock.h:	GMT_GCAL_EPOCH has become obsolete.
	* gmt_globals.h:	Changed default time_epoch from 2000-01-01 midnight to noon.

				unit can be found in GMT_DEFAULTS struct.
	* src/GNUmakefile, gmt_grdio.c, gmt_calclock.c:	Changed accordingly.
	* gmt_defaults.txt:	Updated to reflect changes.
	* .gmtdefaults_test, .gmtdefaults_*.orig, .gmtdefaults4.doc:	Removed TIME_SYSTEM.

2008-02-19	pwessel

	* bin/gmtlogo:		Now scales logo up properly to get better resolution

2008-01-31	pwessel

	* doc/GMT_device*.tex:	Removed: no longer needed now that device dependencies are done in GMT_macros.tex.
	* doc/GMT_macros.tex:	Completely revised: now does all common things of GMT_Tutorial and GMT_Docs.
				Added \usepackage{tocbibind} to add toc, bib and ind to Contents.
				Better organised hyperref package. Now implied by \usepackage{html}.

2007-01-14
	* gmt_io.c:		Added GMT_not_numeric(text) function to determine if a text string CANNOT
				possibly be a number.  Used in gmtmath.c/grdmath.c to limit warnings.

	* pscoast.c:		Now requires a map projection (-JX<width> will give error since the
				data is lon,lat.)
	* gmt_mgg2_header2.[ch]:	NGDC has updated the GRD98 format so that the previously unused variable
				unused1 now will hold cell registation (1 = pixel, 0 = gridline), thus
				extending the GRD98 format to pixel grids as well.
				Fixed a bug in which the grid format type (12) got reset to 0, thus
				making grdinfo report the wrong file format.

				and -Z in header will decode to corresponding pattern.
				New feature: -W- -W+ will turn off outline or reset to default
				while -G- -G+ will turn off fill or reset to default (in -M).

2006-11-08
	* gmt_init.c:		2006-10-03 fix for Windows was botched; format should have been %c not %s

2006-11-06
	* sample1d.c:		Allow absolute time in -S option (using GMT_scanf_arg).
	* gmtmath.c:		-C now works (used to deselect all columns).

	* make_make.sh:		Now creates grdmath.h and gmtmath.h from grdmath.c and gmtmath.c

2006-11-03
	* gmtmath.c:		Fixed memory allocation bug for files > BUFSIZ records.  Now works correctly
				with multisegment headers.  Multisegment headers now written to the output file
				and not always to stdout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2006-11-02
	* tar 4.1.4 made and released via email
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-03-07
	* gmt_io.c:		For years, date in format needs %5d, not %4d since we might have
				a negative year (months and days, however, only need %2d).
				With %4d, dates like -4321-01-01 was read as -432-01-01.

2006-03-06

1998-12-09
	* *:			All internal calculations in GMT are now done
				using inches.  All input lengths (e.g., map
				scales or widths, distance gaps, symbols sizes,
				etc) that previously were taken as inches or as
				either inch/cm are now scanned to see if they
				have the unit c, i, m, or p appended (c = cm,
				i = inch, m = meter, p = point).  If no unit is
				appended, GMT will default to the unit set by
				MEASURE_UNIT.  Thus, even if MEASURE_UNIT is cm
				one can specify a 6 inch map with -JM6i.
				All the man pages have also been updated.
	* psmegaplot.c:		Updated to deal with GMT 3.0 PS format.  No
				longer need PS files produced with -K at the end.
	* job??.{csh,bash}:	Now employ unit-independent widths, sizes and
				pens.  Should give identical results regardless
				of which MEASURE_UNIT is in effect.

1998-12-08
	* grdimage.c:		Had two problems: 1) Clip path did not follow
				the grid but the -R region. 2) images sometimes
				were shifted incorrectly.  Both problems fixed.
	* grdview.c:		Clip path now based on grid, not -R.
				Pixel grids are now processed correctly.

1998-12-02
	* psclip.c:		fclose outside file loop so only ~95 files could
				be opened before we run out of file pointers...
	* gmtselect.c:		Added friendly check to ensure -L and -F gets a
				multisegment file.

1998-12-01
	* gmt_customio.c:	Now reads/writes format # 3 Sun rasterfile header
				correctly on all platforms, like pslib.c
				If you ever used GMT to write Sun rasterfiles
				under Linux, you need to fix the raster headers.

1998-11-30
	* pslib.c:		Added support for Run-Length Encoded rasterfiles.
				PS. this feature has not been extensively tested
				at this point since I haven't gotten many RLE
				files to test on.  Also fixed a bug for 24-bit
				images of odd width.
	* gmthex2ras.c:		Obsolete since Sun rasterfiles are defined at
				the byte level so new read-module in pslib works
				on all platforms.  The GMT patterns will now be
				distributed as binary rasterfiles.

1998-11-29
	* pslib.c:		Read Sun rasters incorrectly on bigendian
				machines.  Now should work ok on all platforms.
	* gmtselect.c:		Now takes -N (and -A, D) to keep/skip points that
				are inside/outside any geographical features
				(coastlines).

1998-11-28

				gmt_shore.c as a new function.
	* grdlandmask.c:	Now uses GMT_prep_polygons instead of duplicate
				code from pscoast.  All progs needing to extract
				and use coastline polygons will use this routine.

1998-11-26
	* grd2xyz.c:		Now gives warning if -bo and -Z are selected.
	* xyz2grd.c:		Now gives warning if -bi and -Z are selected.

1998-11-25
	* project.c:		Got hung if -W or -L was set.  Fixed many typos
				in both man page and usage message.

				segment headers gives n_fields = 0
	* grdtrack.c:		Failed for -M files; now checks for n_fields >= 0
	* mapproject.c:		Same.
	* pshistogram.c:	Same.
	* psmask.c:		Same.
	* spectrum1d.c:		Same.

				to symbols.

1998-11-10
	* Makefile:		Replaced USER with PROGS to avoid conflicts
				with $USER in shells.  Added gmt_boundcond.h
				to list of include files in makefile.

1998-11-09

				are passed through if both input and output
				modes are ASCII.

1998-11-02
	* grdvolume.c:		Added -Z and -L options; also tighter error
				checking on arguments.
	* grdcontour.c:		Upper left node was not changed by -Z.

1998-10-30
	* psxy[z].c:		Needed to differentiate between number
				of required versus expected columns,
				since binary must read all columns.
	* *.c:			All programs that have -bi option are given
				reasonable default values for the number of
				columns that is expected.  This can always be
				overridden by -bi[s]<n>.

				so a test failed that assumed it was zero.

1998-10-29
	* blockmode.c:		New program for block mode estimates.
	* blockmedian.c:	Now takes -Q to return (x,y) at median z
				value rather than median x, median y.

1998-10-28
	* GMT:			Now under GNU General Public License.
	* gmt_init.c:		Updating of .gmtdefaults is now using
				advisory file locking.  This means that
				only one GMT program will be able to
				read and write to the .gmtcommands file
				at any time.  In GMT 3.0 and earlier
				versions it happened that a later GMT
				call in a series of pipes would try
				to read while another program was busy
				updating the file.
	* *.c:			Programs now update the .gmtcommands
				file immediately after error checking.
