OPT(A)
Features with an area smaller than \fImin_area\fP in km^2 or of hierarchical level
that is lower than \fImin_level\fP or higher than \fImax_level\fP
will not be plotted [Default is 0/0/4 (all features)].  Level 2 (lakes) contains
regular lakes and wide river bodies which we normally include as lakes;
append \fB+r\fP to just get river-lakes or \fB+l\fP to just get regular lakes
(requires GSHHS 2.0.1 or higher).  Finally, append \fB+p\fP\fIpercent\fP to exclude
polygons whose percentage area of the corresponding full-resolution feature is less
than \fIpercent\fP (requires GSHHS 2.0 or higher).
See GSHHS INFORMATION below for more details.
