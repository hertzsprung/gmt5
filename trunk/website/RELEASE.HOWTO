#		FOR 4.x SERIES

PRE-RELEASE TASKS:

1.  Decide on a future date at which point GMT is to be released.
    Be prepared to change the date if the  bug-fixing workload is
    too great.  Send email to gmt-team@hawaii.edu and tell
    them the date and ask for updates.
    
RELEASE TASKS:

When you are ready to officially release a new GMT version you
must ensure you do all the steps listed below:

0.  Make any changes to README, README.WIN32, and Changelog.
    Finalize Announcements/Announce.4.*.  Make sure the macros
    in the gmtsite.macros file points to the actual FTP and WWW dirs.
    Check version number and release data in configure.ac and install_gmt.

1.  run make latest-config
    get the latest config.sub and config.guess.  Make sure this worked
    since sometimes we get blank files...
    cd website
    
2.  Run cvs commit from the main GMT directory to check in any
    uncommitted changes.

3.  Compile and make all to make sure it all works (check examples)
    make site
   
4.  In GMT/ftp, update .message, README.GMT, and VERSION

5.  In GMT/website:
    a) Update gmt_arrrghh.html, gmt_faq.html, gmt_home.html,
       gmt_install_form.html, gmt_news.html, gmt_releases_template.html
       install_gmt_form.pl, gmt_nav.html
    b) create web examples:
       make web
    c) test the update of ftp and web sites locally:
       make update-version-local
    d) If OK, update the remote TEST ftp and web sites:
       make update-version-test
       Have team members install from these sites.

If still good to go:

6.  Tag the release(s), e.g.
    cvs -q tag Release_2010_07_15_GMT_4_5_3

7.  Prepare the archives:
    make archive >& log

8.  Determine file sizes of all archives and update these values
    in guru/install_gmt and website/gmt_install_form.html

9.  Edit the *.iss files and run GMT_winbuild.bat under Parallels which will build
    the three Windows installers and place them in GMT/ftp.

10. Release the new version with make update-version-live.

11. Send email notifications:
    a) Alert the mirror sites (gmt-mirrors) that a new version has been posted.
    b) Send email to gmt-help and gmt-group with the Announcement.
