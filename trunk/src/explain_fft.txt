FFT_OPT[GMT_FFT_OPT]
Choose or inquire about suitable grid dimensions for FFT and set optional parameters.
OPT(Nf) will force the FFT to use the actual dimensions of the data.
OPT(Nq) will inQuire about more suitable dimensions, report those, then continue.
OPT(Ns) will present a list of optional dimensions, then exit.
OPT(N)IT(nx/ny) will do FFT on array size IT(nx/ny) (must be >= grid file size).
Default chooses dimensions >= data which optimize speed and accuracy of FFT.
If FFT dimensions > grid file dimensions, data are extended and tapered to zero.
Use modifiers to control how the extension and tapering are to be performed:
BD(+e) extends the grid by imposing edge-point symmetry [Default], BD(+m) extends
the grid by imposing edge mirror symmetry, while BD(+n) turns off data extension.
Tapering is performed from the data edge to the FFT grid edge [100%]. Change
this percentage via BD(+t)IT(width). When BD(+n) is in effect, the tapering
is applied instead to the data margins as no extension is available [0%].
For detailed investigation you can write the intermediate grid being passed to the
forward FFT; this is likely to have been
detrended, extended by point-symmetry along all edges, and tapered.  Append BD(+w)[IT(suffix)]
from which output file name(s) will be created (i.e., IT(ingrid)_IT(prefix).IT(ext)) [tapered],
where IT(ext) is your file extension.
Finally, you may save the complex grid produced by the forward FFT by appending BD(+z).
By default we write the real and imaginary components to IT(ingrid)_IT(real).IT(ext) and IT(ingrid)_imag.IT(ext).
Append BD(p) to save instead the polar form of magnitude and phase to files IT(ingrid)_mag.IT(ext) and IT(ingrid)_phase.IT(ext).
