.SH NAME
segy2grd \- Converting SEGY file to grid file format
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsegy2grd\fP \fIsegyfile\fP OPT(G)\fIgrdfile\fP GMT_I_OPT
GMT_Rgeo_OPT [ OPT(A)[\fBn\fP|\fBz\fP] ] [ GMT_GRDEDIT ]
[ OPT(F) ]   [ OPT(N)\fInodata\fP ] [ OPT(S)[\fIzfile\fP] ] [ GMT_V_OPT ]
[ OPT(Z)[\fIflags\fP] ] [ GMT_t_OPT ] [ GMT_bi_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsegy2grd\fP reads an IEEE SEGY file and
creates a binary grid file. Either a simple mapping (equivalent to xyz2grd -Z) or a more complicated
averaging where a particular grid cell includes values from more than one sample in the SEGY file can be done.
\fBsegy2grd\fP will report if some of the nodes are not filled in with
data. Such unconstrained nodes are set to a value specified by the user [Default is NaN].
Nodes with more than one value will be set to the average value.
.TP
\fIsegyfile\fP
ASCII [or binary] file holding z or (x,y,z) values. xyz triplets do not
have to be sorted (for binary triplets, see \fB\-b\fP). 1-column z tables must be sorted and the \fB\-Z\fP must be set).
.TP
.B \-G
\fIgrdfile\fP is the name of the binary output grid file.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIx_inc\fP [and optionally \fIy_inc\fP] is the grid spacing. Append \fBm\fP to indicate minutes or \fBc\fP to indicate seconds.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Add up multiple values that belong to the same node (same as \fB\-Az\fP).
Append \fBn\fP to simply count the number of data points that were assigned to each node.
[Default (no \fB\-A\fP option) will calculate mean value]. Not used for simple mapping.
.TP
.B \-D
Give values for \fIxname, yname, zname, scale, offset, title,\fP and \fIremark\fP.
To leave some of these values untouched, specify = as the value.
.TP
.B \-F
Force pixel registration [Default is grid registration].
.TP
.B \-N
No data. Set nodes with no input sample to this value [Default is NaN].
.TP
.B \-S
set variable spacing \fIheader\fP is c for cdp, o for offset, b<number> for 4-byte float starting at byte number
If -S not set, assumes even spacing of samples at the dx, dy supplied with -I
.TP
.B \-L
Override number of samples in each trace
.TP
.B \-X
applies scalar \fIx-scale\fP to coordinates in trace header to match the coordinates specified in -R
.TP
.B \-Y
Specifies sample interval as \fIs_int\fP if incorrect in the SEGY file
.TP
.B \-M
Fix number of traces to read in. Default tries to read 10000 traces.
-M0 will read number in binary header, -Mn will attempt to read only n traces.

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a grid file from an even spaced SEGY file test.segy, try
.br
.sp
segy2grd test.segy \fB\-I\fP0.1/0.1
\fB\-G\fPtest.grd \fB\-R\fP198/208/18/25 \fB\-V\fP
.br
.sp
Note that this will read in 18-25s (or km) on each trace, but the first trace will be assumed to be at
X=198
.br
.sp
To create a grid file from the SEGY file test.segy, locating traces according to the CDP number, where
there are 10 CDPs per km and the sample interval is 0.1, try
.br
.sp
segy2grd test.segy  \fB\-G\fPtest.grd \fB\-R\fP0/100/0/10 \fB\-I\fP0.5/0.2 \fB\-V \-X\fP0.1  \fB\-Y\fP0.1
.br
.sp
Because the grid interval is larger than the SEGY file sampling, the individual samples will be averaged
in bins
