Description: GSHHS shorelines, rivers, borders (high res)
DescDetail: <<
 This package provides two high-resolution versions of the GSHHS
 (Global Self-consistant Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines)
 data base: high and full resolution.
 GSHHS combines the World Vector Shoreline and World Data Base II
 products into a single quality-checked hierarchical data base at
 5 resolutions.

 Although these shorelines are distributed as part of the Generic Mapping
 Tools (GMT), they can be used stand-alone or with other applications
 that can read NetCDF files.
<<
DescPort: <<
 These high-resolution coastlines are recommended for the use with the
 gmt package (but not essential).
 Standard coastlines can be found in the gshhs-lores package.
