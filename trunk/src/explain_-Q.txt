.B \-Q
Quick mode, use bilinear rather than bicubic interpolation [Default].  Optionally, append \fIvalue\fP in the
0 <= \fIvalue\fP <= 1 range.  This parameter controls how close to nodes with NaN values the
interpolation will go.  E.g., a \fIvalue\fP of 0.5 will interpolate about 1/2-way from a non-NaN to a
NaN node, whereas 0.1 will go about 90% of the way, etc. [Default is 1, which means none of the four nearby
nodes may be NaN].  A \fIvalue\fP of 0 will just return the value of the nearest node instead of interpolating.
