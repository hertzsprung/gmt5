	* doc/html.sty:		Removed: prefer to use official version. GMT_macros.tex changed to accomodate:
				Need to just call \usepackage{html}: it implies \usepackage{hyperref}.

	* doc/GMT_device*.tex:	Removed: no longer needed now that device dependencies are done in GMT_macros.tex.
	* doc/GMT_macros.tex:	Completely revised: now does all common things of GMT_Tutorial and GMT_Docs.
				Added \usepackage{tocbibind} to add toc, bib and ind to Contents.
				Better organised hyperref package. Now implied by \usepackage{html}.

2007-01-14
	* gmt_io.c:		Added GMT_not_numeric(text) function to determine if a text string CANNOT

2006-11-14
	* segyprogs/segy_io.h:	Now includes inttypes.h only when required
	* pscoast.c:		Now requires a map projection (-JX<width> will give error since the
				data is lon,lat.)
	* gmt_mgg2_header2.[ch]:	NGDC has updated the GRD98 format so that the previously unused variable
				unused1 now will hold cell registation (1 = pixel, 0 = gridline), thus
				extending the GRD98 format to pixel grids as well.
				Fixed a bug in which the grid format type (12) got reset to 0, thus
				making grdinfo report the wrong file format.
	* grdfft.c:		-D and -I option could have junk in the parameter arrays if more than

				and -Z in header will decode to corresponding pattern.
				New feature: -W- -W+ will turn off outline or reset to default
				while -G- -G+ will turn off fill or reset to default (in -M).

2006-11-08
	* gmt_init.c:		2006-10-03 fix for Windows was botched; format should have been %c not %s

2006-11-06
	* sample1d.c:		Allow absolute time in -S option (using GMT_scanf_arg).
	* gmtmath.c:		-C now works (used to deselect all columns).

	* make_make.sh:		Now creates grdmath.h and gmtmath.h from grdmath.c and gmtmath.c

2006-11-03
	* gmtmath.c:		Fixed memory allocation bug for files > BUFSIZ records.  Now works correctly
				with multisegment headers.  Multisegment headers now written to the output file
				and not always to stdout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2006-11-02
	* tar 4.1.4 made and released via email

	* grdcontour.c:		-W[+][c|a] was susceptible to misinterpreting things like -Wcyan as color yan.
	* grdview.c:		-W[c|m] was susceptible to misinterpreting things like -Wcyan as color yan.
	* pstext.c:		-W[<fill>][o|O|c|C][<pen]] is now -W[<fill>,][o|O|c|C][<pen]], i.e., we now use
				a comma to separate the fill and pen (done since fill may be a name containing o|c.
	* psimage.c:		-G<colorname> (e.g., -Gblack) will now be interpreted as foreground color, e.g. -Gfblack

2006-10-29
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Make units check case-insensitive. Check for toggled lat/lon coordinates.
				Fixed time-scaling bug on input (was always seconds).
	* gmt_io.c:		One can now add suffixes 'g' or 'd' to denote geographic coordinates.
	* gmt_init.c:		Made use of geographical and time coordinates more "transparent":
				-R[g|d] forces geographical, so that -JX does not need extra d
				When absolute or relative time is used in -R, -JX does not need extra T or t
				-R[g|d]w/e/s/n[r] also sets geographical.
				Made use of lower and uppercase LlPpDdTtGg consistent.

2006-10-28
	* xyz2grd.c:		Fixed bug in -E header section parsing.

				-F did not use grid registration as default, rather that of input grid
				When using pixel registration, number of cells would be one too large
				-L worked only in very limited case: going from x=[-180;180] to x=[0;360]
				Now supports any periodicity in X and Y (as per manual)

2006-03-07
	* gmt_io.c:		For years, date in format needs %5d, not %4d since we might have
				a negative year (months and days, however, only need %2d).

	* GMT:			Added -Jv (van der Grinten) projection
				Added -Jd (Equidistant conic) projection
				Added -Jkf Eckert IV (f for 4).  Also allow

1999-04-27
	* gmt_defaults.h:	Without .gmtdefaults, paper size was 0x0
	* install_gmt:		Now figures out if binary files written on Suns
				(e.g., data files like world_grav etc) need to be
				swapped on the user's machine.  This is used to
				compile in swapping in some of the supplemental
				programs. Not used by main GMT programs.
	* img2mercgrd.c:	Compiles in swapping if install_gmt says so.

1999-04-12
	* grdraster.c:		Did not open files as binary (which is required

1999-04-08
	* pslib.c:		Missed final linefeed when -K and absolute
				positioning (-Xa? -Ya?) were used.
	* grdimage.c:		Shit! Somehow, MAPPING was replaced by
				!RECT_GRATICULE on 1998-12-08, i.e. after 3.1.1
				Now fixed (again). All grdimage plots made since
				3.2 came out have problems if they use a map
				projection that had rectangular graticules, like
				Mercator and many cylindrical projections.

1999-04-07
	* pslib.c:		Now knows about DOS drive letters in any
				pattern filenames

	* sample1d.c:		Had memory allocation errors with -M.
				Now also works with -N file that spans the
				range of several -M segments.
	* gmt_plot.c:		GMT_polar_adjust sensitive to round-off which
				could affect orientation of basemap annotations
	* gmt_math_init.csh/bash:	Had wrong #define for the dummy yn(n,x) function

1999-03-26
	* pslib.c:		Added ps_imagemask for transparent bitmaps
	* gmt_support.c:	Understands that fore- or background color in
				-Gp can be - which means transparency

	* grdimage.c:		New -G[f|b]<rgb> option to make transparent
				color masks from otherwise black/white 1-bit
				images

				M (PLM), the fully normalized surface spherical
				harmonic YLM, and POP (delete top stack element).
	* gmtmath.c:		Added PLM and POP, see above.
	* pstext.c:		Now clips same way as psxy.

1999-01-02
	* grdmath.c:		Added j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc
				which is present in most math libraries,
				and bei, ber, kei, ker from gmt_math.c
				Also log1p which we already use elsewhere.
	* gmtmath.c:		New program with same operators as grdmath
				except it works on tables instead of grids.
	* gmt_math.c:		Contains definitions of bei, ber, kei, ker.
	* gmt_math_init.csh/bash:	Looks for j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc

				when south was not multiple of y_inc.

1998-12-09
	* *:			All internal calculations in GMT are now done
				using inches.  All input lengths (e.g., map
				scales or widths, distance gaps, symbols sizes,
				etc) that previously were taken as inches or as
				either inch/cm are now scanned to see if they
				have the unit c, i, m, or p appended (c = cm,
				i = inch, m = meter, p = point).  If no unit is
				appended, GMT will default to the unit set by
				MEASURE_UNIT.  Thus, even if MEASURE_UNIT is cm
				one can specify a 6 inch map with -JM6i.
				All the man pages have also been updated.
	* psmegaplot.c:		Updated to deal with GMT 3.0 PS format.  No
				longer need PS files produced with -K at the end.

				of which MEASURE_UNIT is in effect.

1998-12-08
	* grdimage.c:		Had two problems: 1) Clip path did not follow
				the grid but the -R region. 2) images sometimes
				were shifted incorrectly.  Both problems fixed.
	* grdview.c:		Clip path now based on grid, not -R.
				Pixel grids are now processed correctly.

1998-12-02
	* psclip.c:		fclose outside file loop so only ~95 files could
				be opened before we run out of file pointers...
	* gmtselect.c:		Added friendly check to ensure -L and -F gets a
				multisegment file.

1998-12-01
	* gmt_customio.c:	Now reads/writes format # 3 Sun rasterfile header
				correctly on all platforms, like pslib.c
				If you ever used GMT to write Sun rasterfiles
				under Linux, you need to fix the raster headers.

1998-11-30
	* pslib.c:		Added support for Run-Length Encoded rasterfiles.
				PS. this feature has not been extensively tested
				at this point since I haven't gotten many RLE
				files to test on.  Also fixed a bug for 24-bit
				images of odd width.
	* gmthex2ras.c:		Obsolete since Sun rasterfiles are defined at
				the byte level so new read-module in pslib works
				on all platforms.  The GMT patterns will now be
				distributed as binary rasterfiles.

1998-11-29
	* pslib.c:		Read Sun rasters incorrectly on bigendian
				machines.  Now should work ok on all platforms.
	* gmtselect.c:		Now takes -N (and -A, D) to keep/skip points that
				are inside/outside any geographical features
				(coastlines).

1998-11-28

	* pscoast.c:		Now uses GMT_prep_polygons which is defined in
				gmt_shore.c as a new function.
	* grdlandmask.c:	Now uses GMT_prep_polygons instead of duplicate
				code from pscoast.  All progs needing to extract
				and use coastline polygons will use this routine.

1998-11-26
	* grd2xyz.c:		Now gives warning if -bo and -Z are selected.
	* xyz2grd.c:		Now gives warning if -bi and -Z are selected.

1998-11-25
	* project.c:		Got hung if -W or -L was set.  Fixed many typos
				in both man page and usage message.
	* psscale.l:		Had old-style -B example.

				segment headers gives n_fields = 0
	* grdtrack.c:		Failed for -M files; now checks for n_fields >= 0
	* mapproject.c:		Same.
	* pshistogram.c:	Same.
	* psmask.c:		Same.
	* spectrum1d.c:		Same.

				with $USER in shells.  Added gmt_boundcond.h
				to list of include files in makefile.
