.SH NAME
x2sys_get \- Get track listing from the x2sys track index databases
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(T)IT(TAG) [ OPT(C) ] [ OPT(D) ] [ OPT(E) ] [ OPT(F)IT(flags) ] 
[ OPT(L)[IT(list)] ] [ OPT(N)IT(flags) ] [ OPT(Qe)|BD(i) ]  [ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(x2sys_get) will return the names of the track data files in the x2sys data
base for this TAG that match the given
requirements.  You may choose a specific region and optionally ask
only for tracks that meet certain data criteria.  Finally, you may
select an option to list all possible pairs that might generate crossovers.
#include "explain_tag.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(C)
Instead of reporting the track names, just output the coordinates of the
center of each bin that has at least one track with the specified data.
.TP
OPT(D)
Only report the track names [Default adds the availability of
data for each field].
.TP
OPT(E)
Append the file extension to all reported tracks [no extension].
.TP
OPT(F)
Give a comma-separated list of column names (as described in the definition
file) that should all be present within the selected region. [Default selects all data columns].
A track will be included in the returned list if at least one bin reports
that the track has all of the listed columns.
.TP
OPT(L)
Crossover mode.  Return a list of track pairs that should be checked for possible
crossovers.  The list is determined from the bin-index data base on the assumption
that tracks occupying the same bin are very likely to intersect.  By default we
return all possible pairs in the data base.  Append the name of a file with a
list of tracks if you want to limit the output to those pairs that involve
at least one of the track names in your list.  The output is suitable for the OPT(K)
option in \fBx2sys_cross\fP.
.TP
OPT(N)
Give a comma-separated list of column names (as described in the definition
file) that all must be absent.  A track will be excluded from the returned list
if at least one bin reports that the track some all of the listed columns. 
.TP
OPT(Q)
Append \fBe\fP for external COEs only, and \fBi\fP for internal
COEs only [Default is all COEs].  This applies to the crossover setup only
and requires OPT(L).
#include "explain_-Rgeo.txt"
For Cartesian data just give \fIxmin/xmax/ymin/ymax\fP.  This option limits
the tracks to those that fall at least partly inside the specified domain.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To find all the tracks associated with the tag MGD77, restricted to occupy
a certain region in the south Pacific, and have at least free air anomalies
and bathymetry, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 OPT(R)180/240/-60/-30 OPT(F)faa,depth 
.br
.sp
To find all the tracks associated with the tag MGD77 that have depth but not
twt, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 OPT(F)depth OPT(N)twt
.br
.sp
To find all the pairs associated with the tag MGD77 that might intersect each
other, but only those pairs which involves tracks in your list new.lis, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(V) OPT(T)MGD77 OPT(L)new.lis > xpairs.lis
.SH NOTE
The tracks that are returned all have the requested data (OPT(F)) within the
specified region (OPT(R)).  Furthermore, the columns of Y and N for other data types
also reflect the content of the track portion within the selected region.
