.TH MGD77INFO GMTMANSECTION DATE VERSION VERSION
.SH NAME
mgd77info \- Get information about MGD77[+] files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmgd77info\fP \fIleg-ids\fP [ \fB\-C\fP[\fBm|e\fP] ] [ \fB\-E\fP[\fBm|e\fP] ] [ \fB\-L\fP ] 
[ \fB\-I\fP\fIignore\fP ] [ \fB\-V\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmgd77info\fP reads <legid>.[mgd77|nc] files and produces a single record of information
about each cruise specified.  The information includes beginning and end time, total
track distance in km, min and max regional extent, and the total number of geophysical
observations.  Optionally, choose instead to see the original MGD77 header section.
.br
If you need to know which tracks are crossing through a given region and what kinds
of geogphysical observations are available, consider using the x2sys tools to set up
a tracks index data base (see \fBx2sys_init\fP for more information).
.TP
\fIleg-ids\fP
Can be one or more MGD77 8-character cruise identifiers. To give a list of names, use `cat cruises.lis`.
The ".mgd77" extension will automatically be appended, if needed.  Cruise files will be looked for
in the current directory and in all directories listed in \fB$MGD77_DIR\fP/mgd77_paths.txt
[If \fB$MGD77_DIR\fP is not set it defaults to \fB$GMTHOME\fP/share/mgd77].
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments
.TP
.B \-C
List abbreviations for all columns present in the MGD77[+] files.
Append \fBm\fP or \fBe\fP to limit the display to the MGD77 or MGD77+ extended set only.
.TP
.B \-E
Give a one-line summary for each cruise listed.
.TP
.B \-I
Ignore certain data file formats from consideration. Append \fBa|c|t\fP to ignore
MGD77 ASCII, MGD77+ netCDF, or plain tab-separated ASCII table files, respectively. The option may
be repreated to ignore more than one format.  [Default ignores none].
.TP
.B \-L
Give the long MGD77 header section for each cruise listed and history, if present.
