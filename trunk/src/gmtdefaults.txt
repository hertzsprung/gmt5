.SH NAME
gmtdefaults \- To list current \fBGMT\fP defaults
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgmtdefaults\fP OPT(D)[\fBu\fP|\fBs\fP] | OPT(L)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmtdefaults\fP lists the 
\fBGMT\fP parameter defaults if the option OPT(D) is used.  There are three ways to change some of the settings:
(1) Use the command \fBgmtset\fP, (2) use any texteditor to edit the file \.gmtdefaults4 in your home, ~/.gmt
or current directory (if you do not have this file, run 
\fBgmtdefaults\fP -D > ~/.gmtdefaults4 to get one with the system default settings), or (3) override any parameter
by specifying one or more PAR(PARAMETER,VALUE) statements on the commandline of any \fBGMT\fP command
(\fBPARAMETER\fP and \fBVALUE\fP are any combination listed below).  The
first two options are permanent changes until explicitly changed back, while the last option is ephemeral
and only applies to the single \fBGMT\fP command that received the override.
\fBGMT\fP can provide default values in US or SI units.  This choice is determined by the contents of the
gmt.conf file in \fBGMT\fP's share directory.\"'
.TP
OPT(D)
Print the system \fBGMT\fP defaults to standard output.  Append \fBu\fP for US
defaults or \fBs\fP for SI defaults. [OPT(D) alone gives current choice in gmt.conf].
.TP
OPT(L)
Print the user's currently active defaults to standard output.\"'
.br
.sp
Your currently active defaults come from the \.gmtdefaults4 file in the 
current working directory, if present; else from the \.gmtdefaults4 file 
in your home directory, if present; else from the file ~/.gmt/.gmtdefaults4, if present;
else from the system defaults set at the time \fBGMT\fP was compiled.
.SH \fBGMT\fP PARAMETERS
The following is a list of the parameters that are user-definable in \fBGMT\fP.  The
parameter names are always given in UPPER CASE.  The parameter values are
case-insensitive unless otherwise noted.  The
system defaults are given in brackets [ for SI (and US) ].  Those marked \fB*\fP can be set on the command
line as well (the corresponding option is given in parentheses).  Note that default distances and
lengths below are given in both cm or inch; the chosen default depends on your choice of default
unit (see \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP).  You can explicitly specify the unit used for distances and
lengths by appending \fBc\fP (cm), \fBi\fP (inch), \fBm\fP (meter), or \fBp\fP (points).
When no unit is indicated the value will be assumed to be in the unit set by \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP.
Note that the printer resolution \fBDOTS_PR_INCH\fP is always the number of dots or pixels per inch.
Several parameters take only TRUE or FALSE.
.TP

.TP
.B ANNOT_FONT_SIZE_PRIMARY
Font size (> 0) for map annotations  [14p].
.TP
.B ANNOT_FONT_SECONDARY
Font to use for time axis secondary annotations.  See \fBANNOT_FONT_PRIMARY\fP for available fonts  [Helvetica].
.TP
.B ANNOT_FONT_SIZE_SECONDARY
Font size (> 0) for time axis secondary annotations  [16p].
.TP
.B ANNOT_MIN_ANGLE
If the angle between the map boundary and the annotation baseline is less than this minimum value (in degrees), the
annotation is not plotted (this may occur for certain oblique projections.)  Give a value in the
range 0\-90. [20]
.TP
.B ANNOT_MIN_SPACING
If an annotation would be plotted less than this minimum distance from its closest neighbor, the
annotation is not plotted (this may occur for certain oblique projections.) [0]
.TP
.B ANNOT_OFFSET_PRIMARY
Distance from end of tickmark to start of annotation [LEN_1_SI (or LEN_1_US)].  A negative
offset will place the annotation inside the map border.
.TP
.B ANNOT_OFFSET_SECONDARY
Distance from base of primary annotation to the top of the secondary annotation [LEN_1_SI (or LEN_1_US)] (Only
applies to time axes with both primary and secondary annotations).
.TP
.B BASEMAP_AXES
Sets which axes to draw and annotate.  Case sensitive: Upper case means both draw and annotate, lower case
means draw axis only.  [WESN].
.TP
.B BASEMAP_FRAME_RGB
Color used to draw map boundaries and annotations.
Give a red/green/blue triplet, with each element in the 0\-255 range.
Prepend '+' to replicate this color to the tick-, grid-, and frame-pens.
[0/0/0] (black).
.TP
.B BASEMAP_TYPE
Choose between inside, plain and fancy (thick boundary, alternating black/white frame; append + for rounded corners)  [fancy].
For some map projections (e.g., Oblique Mercator), plain is the only option even if fancy is set as default.
In general, fancy only applies to situations where the projected x and y directions parallel the lon and lat
directions (e.g., rectangular projections, polar projections).  For situations where all boundary ticks and annotations
must be inside the maps (e.g., for preparing geotiffs), chose inside.
.TP
.B CHAR_ENCODING
Names the eight bit character set being used for text in files and in command line parameters. This allows \fBGMT\fP
to ensure that the \fIPostScript\fP output generates the correct characters on the plot..  Choose from Standard, Standard+, ISOLatin1, ISOLatin1+,
and ISO-8859-x (where x is in the ranges 1-10 or 13-15).  See Appendix F for details [CODE_SI (or CODE_US)].
.TP
.B COLOR_BACKGROUND
Color used for the background of images (i.e., when z < lowest colortable entry).
Give a red/green/blue triplet, with each element in the 0\-255 range. [0/0/0] (black)
.TP
.B COLOR_FOREGROUND
Color used for the foreground of images (i.e., when z > highest colortable entry).
Give a red/green/blue triplet, with each element in the 0\-255 range. [255/255/255] (white)
.TP
.B COLOR_IMAGE
Selects which operator to use when rendering bit-mapped color images.  Due to the
lack of the colorimage operator in some \fIPostScript\fP implementations, as well as
some \fIPostScript\fP editors inability to handle color gradations, \fBGMT\fP offers
two different options:
.br
.sp
	adobe (Adobe's colorimage definition)  [Default].\"'
.br
	tiles (Plot image as many individual rectangles).
.br
.TP
.B COLOR_MODEL
Selects if color palette files contain RGB values (r,g,b in 0-255 range), HSV values
(h in 0-360, s,v in 0-1 range), or CMYK values (c,m,y,k in 0-1 range).  A \fBCOLOR_MODEL\fP setting in the color palette file
will override this setting.  Internally, color interpolation takes place directly
on the RGB values which can give unexpected hues, whereas interpolation directly on the
HSV values better preserves the hues.  Prepend the prefix "+" to force interpolation in
the selected color system (does not apply to the CMYK system). For this additional option, the defaults take
precedence over the color palette file  [rgb].
.TP
.B COLOR_NAN
Color used for the non-defined areas of images (i.e., where z == NaN).
Give a red/green/blue triplet, with each element in the 0\-255 range. [128/128/128] (gray)
.TP
.B D_FORMAT
Output format (C language printf syntax) to be used when printing double precision floating point numbers.
For geographic coordinates, see \fBOUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT\fP. [%g].
.TP
.B DEGREE_SYMBOL
Determines what symbol is used to plot the degree symbol on geographic map annotations.  Choose between
ring, degree, colon, or none [ring].
.TP
.B DOTS_PR_INCH
Resolution of the plotting device (dpi).  Note that in order to be as compact as possible,
\fBGMT\fP \fIPostScript\fP output uses integer formats only so the resolution should be
set depending on what output device you are using.  E.g, using 300 and sending the output to
a Linotype 300 phototypesetter (2470 dpi) will not take advantage of the extra resolution (i.e.,
positioning on the page and line thicknesses are still only done in steps of 1/300 inch; of course, text will look smoother)  [300].
.TP
.B ELLIPSOID
The (case sensitive) name of the ellipsoid used for the map projections  [WGS-84].  Choose among
.br
.sp
#include "gmtdefaults.i"
.sp
Note that for some global projections, \fBGMT\fP may use a spherical approximation of the
ellipsoid chosen, setting the flattening to zero, and using a mean radius.
A warning will be given when this happens.
If a different
ellipsoid name than those mentioned here is given, \fBGMT\fP will attempt to parse the
name to extract the semi-major axis (\fIa\fP in m) and the flattening. Formats allowed are:
.br
.sp
	\fIa\fP		implies a zero flattening
.br
	\fIa\fP,\fIinv_f\fP	where \fIinv_f\fP is the inverse flattening
.br
	\fIa\fP,\fBb=\fP\fIb\fP	where \fIb\fP is the semi-minor axis (in m)
.br
	\fIa\fP,\fBf=\fP\fIf\fP	where \fIf\fP is the flattening
.br
.sp
This way a
custom ellipsoid (e.g., those used for other planets) may be used. Further note that coordinate
transformations in \fBmapproject\fP can also specify specific datums; see the \fBmapproject\fP
man page for further details and how to view ellipsoid and datum parameters.
.TP
.B FIELD_DELIMITER
This setting determines what character will separate ASCII output data columns written by \fBGMT\fP.  Choose
from tab, space, comma, and none [tab].
.TP
.B FRAME_PEN
Thickness of pen used to draw plain map frame in dpi units or points (append p)  [1.25p].
.TP
.B FRAME_WIDTH
Width (> 0) of map borders for fancy map frame [LEN_1_SI (or LEN_1_US)].
.TP
.B GLOBAL_X_SCALE
Global x-scale (> 0) to apply to plot-coordinates before plotting.  Normally used to shrink
the entire output down to fit a specific height/width  [1.0].
.TP
.B GLOBAL_Y_SCALE
Same, but for y-coordinates  [1.0].
.TP
.B GRID_CROSS_SIZE_PRIMARY
Size (>= 0) of grid cross at lon-lat intersections.  0 means draw continuous gridlines
instead [0].
.TP
.B GRID_CROSS_SIZE_SECONDARY
Size (>= 0) of grid cross at secondary lon-lat intersections.  0 means draw continuous gridlines
instead [0].
.TP
.B GRID_PEN_PRIMARY
Pen thickness used to draw grid lines in dpi units or points (append p) [0.25p].
.TP
.B GRID_PEN_SECONDARY
Pen thickness used to draw grid lines in dpi units or points (append p) [0.5p].
.TP
.B GRIDFILE_FORMAT
Default file format for grids, with optional scale, offset and invalid value, written as
\fIff\fP/\fIscale\fP/\fIoffset\fP/\fIinvalid\fP. The 2-letter format indicator can be one of [\fBbcnsr\fP][\fBbsifd\fP]. The first
letter indicates native \fBGMT\fP binary, old format netCDF, COARDS-compliant netCDF, Surfer format or Sun
Raster format. The second letter stands for byte, short, int, float and double, respectively. When
/\fIinvalid\fP is omitted the appropriate value for the given format is used (NaN or largest negative).
When /\fIscale\fP/\fIoffset\fP is omitted, /1.0/0.0 is used. [nf].
.TP
.B GRIDFILE_SHORTHAND
If TRUE, all grid file names are examined to see if they use the file extension
shorthand discussed in Section 4.17 of the \fBGMT\fP Technical Reference and Cookbook.
If FALSE, no filename expansion is done [FALSE].
.TP
.B HEADER_FONT
Font to use when plotting headers.  See \fBANNOT_FONT_PRIMARY\fP for available fonts  [Helvetica].
.TP
.B HEADER_FONT_SIZE
Font size (> 0) for header  [36p].
.TP
.B HEADER_OFFSET
Distance from top of axis annotations (or axis label, if present) to base of plot header [LEN_6_SI (or LEN_6_US)].
.TP
.B HISTORY
If TRUE, passes the history of past common command options via the hidden .gmtcommands4 file [TRUE].
.TP
.B HSV_MAX_SATURATION
Maximum saturation (0\-1) assigned for most positive intensity value [0.1].
.TP
.B HSV_MIN_SATURATION
Minimum saturation (0\-1) assigned for most negative intensity value [1.0].
.TP
.B HSV_MAX_VALUE
Maximum value (0\-1) assigned for most positive intensity value [1.0].
.TP
.B HSV_MIN_VALUE
Minimum value (0\-1) assigned for most negative intensity value [0.3].
.TP
.B INPUT_CLOCK_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an input clock string is formatted.  This template
is then used to guide the reading of clock strings in data fields.  To properly decode
12-hour clocks, append am or pm (or upper case) to match your data records. As examples,
try hh:mm, hh:mm:ssAM, etc. [hh:mm:ss].
.TP
.B INPUT_DATE_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an input date string is formatted.  This template
is then used to guide the reading of date strings in data fields.  You may specify either
Gregorian calendar format or ISO week calendar format.  Gregorian calendar: Use any
combination of yyyy (or yy for 2-digit years; if so see \fBY2K_OFFSET_YEAR\fP), mm (or o
for abbreviated month name in the current time language),
and dd, with or without delimiters.  For day-of-year data, use jjj instead of mm and/or dd.
Examples can be ddmmyyyy, yy-mm-dd, dd-o-yyyy, yyyy/dd/mm, yyyy-jjj, etc.
ISO Calendar:  Expected template is yyyy[-]W[-]ww[-]d, where ww is ISO week and d is ISO week
day.  Either template must be consistent, e.g., you cannot specify months if you don't specify\"'
years.  Examples are yyyyWwwd, yyyy-Www, etc. [yyyy-mm-dd].
.TP
.B INTERPOLANT
Determines if linear (linear), Akima's spline (akima), natural cubic spline (cubic) or\"'
no interpolation (none) should be used for 1-D interpolations in various programs [akima].
.TP
.B IO_HEADER
(\fB* \-H\fP) Specifies whether input/output ASCII files have header record(s) or not  [FALSE].
.TP
.B LABEL_FONT
Font to use when plotting labels below axes.  See \fBANNOT_FONT_PRIMARY\fP for available fonts  [Helvetica].
.TP
.B LABEL_FONT_SIZE
Font size (> 0) for labels  [24p].
.TP
.B LABEL_OFFSET
Distance from base of axis annotations to the top of the axis label [LEN_5_SI (or LEN_5_US)].
.TP
.B LINE_STEP
Determines the maximum length (> 0) of individual straight line-segments when drawing arcuate lines  [TOL_SI (or TOL_US)]
.TP
.B MAP_SCALE_FACTOR
Changes the default map scale factor used for the Polar Stereographic [0.9996], UTM [0.9996], and Transverse Mercator [1] projections
in order to minimize areal distortion.  Provide a new scale-factor or leave as default.
.TP
.B MAP_SCALE_HEIGHT
Sets the height (> 0) on the map of the map scale bars drawn by various programs [LEN_1_SI (or LEN_1_US)].
.TP
.B MEASURE_UNIT
Sets the unit length.  Choose between cm, inch, m, and point.  [cm].  Note
that, in \fBGMT\fP, one point is defined as 1/72 inch (the \fIPostScript\fP definition), while it
is often defined as 1/72.27 inch in the typesetting industry.  There is no
universal definition.
.TP
.B N_COPIES
(\fB* \-c\fP) Number of plot copies to make  [1].
.TP
.B N_HEADER_RECS
Specifies how many header records to expect if OPT(H) is turned on  [1].
.TP
.B NAN_RECORDS
Determines what happens when input records containing NaNs for \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP (and in some
cases \fIz\fP) are read.  Choose between \fIskip\fP, which will simply report how many bad
records were skipped, and \fIpass\fP [Default], which will pass these records on to the calling programs.
For most programs this will result in output records with NaNs as well, but some will interpret these
NaN records to indicate gaps in a series; programs may then use that information to detect segmentation (if
applicable).
.TP
.B OBLIQUE_ANNOTATION
This integer is a sum of 6 bit flags (most of which only are relevant for oblique projections):
If bit 1 is set (1), annotations will occur wherever a gridline crosses the
map boundaries, else longitudes will be annotated on the lower and upper boundaries only, and latitudes will be
annotated on the left and right boundaries only.  If bit 2 is set (2), then longitude annotations will
be plotted horizontally.  If bit 3 is set (4), then latitude annotations will be plotted horizontally.
If bit 4 is set (8), then oblique tickmarks are extended to give a projection equal to the specified tick_length.
If bit 5 is set (16), tickmarks will be drawn normal to the border regardless of gridline angle.
If bit 6 is set (32), then latitude annotations will be plotted parallel to the border.
To set a combination of these, add up the values in parentheses. [1].
.TP
.B OUTPUT_CLOCK_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an output clock string is to be formatted.  This template
is then used to guide the writing of clock strings in data fields.  To use a floating point
format for the smallest unit (e.g. seconds), append .xxx, where the number of x indicates
the desired precision.  If no floating point is indicated then the smallest specified unit
will be rounded off to nearest integer.  For 12-hour clocks, append am, AM, a.m., or A.M. (\fBGMT\fP
will replace a|A with p|P for pm).  If your template starts with a leading hyphen (-) then each integer item (y,m,d) will be
printed without leading zeros (default uses fixed width formats).  As examples, try
hh:mm, hh.mm.ss, hh:mm:ss.xxxx, hha.m., etc. [hh:mm:ss].
.TP
.B OUTPUT_DATE_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an output date string is to be formatted.  This template
is then used to guide the writing of date strings in data fields.  You may specify either
Gregorian calendar format or ISO week calendar format.  Gregorian calendar: Use any
combination of yyyy (or yy for 2-digit years; if so see \fBY2K_OFFSET_YEAR\fP), mm (or o for
abbreviated month name in the current time language),
and dd, with or without delimiters.  For day-of-year data, use jjj instead of mm and/or dd.
As examples, try yy/mm/dd, yyyy=jjj, dd-o-yyyy, dd-mm-yy, yy-mm, etc.
ISO Calendar:  Expected template is yyyy[-]W[-]ww[-]d, where ww is ISO week and d is ISO week
day.  Either template must be consistant, e.g., you cannot specify months if you don't specify\"'
years.  As examples, try yyyyWww, yy-W-ww-d, etc. If your template starts with a leading hyphen (-) then each integer item (y,m,d) will be
printed without leading zeros (default uses fixed width formats) [yyyy-mm-dd].
.TP
.B OUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an output geographical coordinate is to be formatted.  This template
is then used to guide the writing of geographical coordinates in data fields.  The template is in
general of the form [+|-]D or [+|-]ddd[:mm[:ss]][.xxx][F].  By default, longitudes will be reported in the -180/+180 range.
The various terms have the following purpose:
.sp
.br
+	Output longitude in the 0 to 360 range [-180/+180]
.br
-	Output longitude in the -360 to 0 range [-180/+180]
.br
D	Use \fBD_FORMAT\fP for floating point degrees.
.br
ddd	Fixed format integer degrees
.br
:	delimiter used
.br
mm	Fixed format integer arc minutes
.br
ss	Fixed format integer arc seconds
.br
.xxx	Floating fraction of previous integer field, fixed width.
.br
F	Encode sign using WESN suffix
.br
.sp
The default is +D.
.TP
.B PAGE_COLOR
Sets the color of the imaging background, i.e., the paper.
Give a red/green/blue triplet, with each element in the 0\-255 range. [255/255/255] (white).
.TP
.B PAPER_MEDIA
Sets the physical format of the current plot paper [PAPER_SI (or PAPER_US)].  The following
formats (and their widths and heights in points) are recognized (Additional
site-specific formats may be specified in
the gmt_custom_media.conf file in \fB$GMT_SHAREDIR\fP/conf or ~/.gmt; see that file for details):
.br

For a completely custom format (e.g., for large format plotters) you may also
specify Custom_WxH, where W and H are in points unless you append a unit
to each dimension (\fBc\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBm\fP or \fBp\fP [Default]).
To force the printer to request a manual paper feed, append '-' to the media
name, e.g., A3- will require the user to insert a A3 paper into the printer's\"'
manual feed slot.  To indicate you are making an EPS file, append '+' to the
media name.  Then, \fBGMT\fP will attempt to issue a tight bounding box [Default 
Bounding Box is the paper dimension].
.TP
.B PAGE_ORIENTATION
(\fB* \-P\fP) Sets the orientation of the page.  Choose portrait or landscape  [landscape].
.TP
.B PLOT_CLOCK_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an output clock string is to be plotted.  This template
is then used to guide the formatting of clock strings in plot annotations.  See \fBOUTPUT_CLOCK_FORMAT\fP
for details. [hh:mm:ss].
.TP
.B PLOT_DATE_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an output date string is to be plotted.  This template
is then used to guide the plotting of date strings in data fields.  See \fBOUTPUT_DATE_FORMAT\fP
for details.  In addition, you may use a single o instead of mm (to plot month name) and
u instead of W[-]ww to plot "Week ##".  Both of these text strings will be affected by
the \fBTIME_LANGUAGE\fP, \fBTIME_FORMAT_PRIMARY\fP and \fBTIME_FORMAT_SECONDARY\fP
setting.  [yyyy-mm-dd].
.TP
.B PLOT_DEGREE_FORMAT
Formatting template that indicates how an output geographical coordinate is to be plotted.  This template
is then used to guide the plotting of geographical coordinates in data fields.  See 
\fBOUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT\fP for details.  In addition, you can append A which plots the absolute value of 
the coordinate.  The default is ddd:mm:ss.  Not all items may be plotted as this depends on the annotation 
interval.
.TP
.B POLAR_CAP
Controls the appearance of gridlines near the poles for all azimuthal projections and a few others in which
the geographic poles are plotted as points (Lambert Conic, Hammer, Mollweide, Sinusoidal, and van der Grinten).  Specify either none (in which
case there is no special handling) or \fIpc_lat\fP/\fIpc_dlon\fP.  In that case, normal gridlines are only drawn between
the latitudes -\fIpc_lat\fP/+\fIpc_lat\fP, and above those latitudes the gridlines are spaced at the (presumably coarser)
\fIpc_dlon\fP interval; the two domains are separated by a small circle drawn at the \fIpc_lat\fP latitude [85/90].
.TP
.B PS_COLOR
Determines whether \fIPostScript\fP output should use RGB, HSV, or CMYK when specifying color [rgb].
Note if HSV is selected it does not apply to images which in that case uses RGB.
.TP
.B PS_IMAGE_COMPRESS
Determines if \fIPostScript\fP images are compressed using the Run-Length Encoding scheme (rle),
Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression (lzw), or not at all (none) [lzw].
.TP
.B PS_IMAGE_FORMAT
Determines whether images created in \fIPostScript\fP should use ASCII
or binary format.  The latter takes up less space and executes faster but may choke
some printers, especially those off serial ports.  Select ascii or bin [ascii].
.TP
.B PS_LINE_CAP
Determines how the ends of a line segment will be drawn.  Choose among a \fIbutt\fP cap (default)
where there is no projection beyond the end of the path, a \fIround\fP cap where a
semicircular arc with diameter equal to the linewidth is drawn around the end points,
and \fIsquare\fP cap where a half square of size equal to the linewidth extends beyond
the end of the path [butt].
.TP
.B PS_LINE_JOIN
Determines what happens at kinks in line segments.  Choose among a \fImiter\fP join
where the outer edges of the strokes for the two segments are extended until they
meet at an angle (as in a picture frame; if the angle is too acute, a bevel join is used
instead, with threshold set by \fBPS_MITER_LIMIT\fP), \fIround\fP join where a
circular arc is used to fill in the cracks at the kinks, and \fIbevel\fP join which
is a miter join that is cut off so kinks are triangular in shape [miter].
.TP
.B PS_MITER_LIMIT
Sets the threshold angle in degrees (integer in 0-180 range) used for mitered joins only.
When the angle between joining line segments is smaller than the threshold the corner will
be bevelled instead of mitered.
The default threshold is 35 degrees.
Setting the threshold angle to 0 implies the \fIPostScript\fP default of about 11 degrees.
Setting the threshold angle to 180 causes all joins to be beveled.
.TP
.B PS_VERBOSE
If TRUE we will issue comments in the \fIPostScript\fP file that explain the logic of operations.
These are useful if you need to edit the file and make changes; otherwise you can set it to
FALSE which yields a somewhat slimmer \fIPostScript\fP file [FALSE].
.TP
.B TICK_LENGTH
The length of a tickmark.  Normally, tickmarks are drawn on the outside of
the map boundaries.  To select interior tickmarks, use a negative tick_length [LEN_1_SI (or LEN_1_US)].
.TP
.B TICK_PEN
The pen thickness to be used for tickmarks in dpi units or points (append p) [0.5p].
.TP
.B TIME_EPOCH
Specifies the value of the calendar and clock at the origin (zero point) of relative time units (see \fBTIME_UNIT\fP).
It is a string of the form yyyy-mm-ddT[hh:mm:ss] (Gregorian) or yyyy-Www-ddT[hh:mm:ss] (ISO)
Default is 2000-01-01T12:00:00, the epoch of the J2000 system.
.TP
.B TIME_FORMAT_PRIMARY
Controls how primary month-, week-, and weekday-names are formatted.  Choose among full, abbreviated, and
character.  If the leading f, a, or c are replaced with F, A, and C the entire annotation will be in upper case. 
.TP
.B TIME_FORMAT_SECONDARY
Controls how secondary month-, week-, and weekday-names are formatted.  Choose among full, abbreviated, and
character.  If the leading f, a, or c are replaced with F, A, and C the entire annotation will be in upper case. 
.TP
.B TIME_INTERVAL_FRACTION
Determines if partial intervals at the start and end of an axis should be annotated.  If the range of the partial
interval exceeds the specified fraction of the normal interval stride we will place the annotation centered on the
partial interval  [0.5].
.TP
.B TIME_IS_INTERVAL
Used when input calendar data should be truncated and adjusted to the middle of the relevant interval.
In the following discussion, the unit \fBu\fP can be one of these time units: (\fBy\fP year, \fBo\fP month,
\fBu\fP ISO week, \fBd\fP day, \fBh\fP hour, \fBm\fP minute, and \fBc\fP second).  \fBTIME_IS_INTERVAL\fP
can have any of the following three values: (1) OFF [Default].  No adjustment, time is decoded as given.
(2) +\fIn\fP\fBu\fP.  Activate interval adjustment for input by truncate to previous whole number of \fIn\fP
units and then center time on the following interval.  (3) -\fIn\fP\fBu\fP.  Same, but center time on the
previous interval.  For example, with \fBTIME_IS_INTERVAL\fP = +1o, an input data string like 1999-12 will
be interpreted to mean 1999-12-15T12:00:00.0 (exactly middle of December), while if \fBTIME_IS_INTERVAL\fP = OFF
then that date is interpreted to mean 1999-12-01T00:00:00.0 (start of December)  [OFF].

values of \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP and \fBTIME_UNIT\fP.
.TP
.B TIME_UNIT
Specifies the units of relative time data since epoch (see \fBTIME_EPOCH\fP).
Choose y (year - assumes all years are 365.2425 days), o (month - assumes
all months are of equal length y/12), d (day), h (hour), m (minute), or c (second)  [d].
.TP

so that virtually any text can be used (even not containing any time information)  [%Y %b %d %H:%M:%S].
.TP
.B VECTOR_SHAPE
Determines the shape of the head of a vector.   Normally (i.e., for vector_shape = 0),
the head will be triangular, but can be changed to an arrow (1) or an open V (2).
Intermediate settings give something in between. Negative values (up to -2) are allowed as well  [0].

or vertically (ver_text)  [hor_text].
.TP
.B Y2K_OFFSET_YEAR
When 2-digit years are used to represent 4-digit years (see various \fBDATE_FORMAT\fPs), \fBY2K_OFFSET_YEAR\fP 
gives the first year in a 100-year sequence.  For example, if \fBY2K_OFFSET_YEAR\fP is 1729, then numbers 
29 through 99 correspond to 1729 through 1799, while numbers 00 through 28 correspond to 1800 through 
1828. [1950].
