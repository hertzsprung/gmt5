.TP
.B \-R
\fIxmin, xmax, ymin,\fP and \fIymax\fP specify the Region of interest.  For geographic
regions, these limits correspond to \fIwest, east, south,\fP and \fInorth\fP and you may specify them
in decimal degrees or in [+-]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format.  Append \fBr\fP if lower left and upper right
map coordinates are given instead of wesn.  For calendar time coordinates you may either give relative
time (relative to the selected TIME_EPOCH and in the selected TIME_UNIT; append \fBt\fP to \fB\-JX|x\fP),
or absolute time of the form [\fIdate\fP]\fBT[\fP\fIclock\fP] (append \fBT\fP to \fB\-JX|x\fP).  At least one of \fIdate\fP and \fIclock\fP
must be present; the \fBT\fP is always required.  The \fIdate\fP string must be of the form [-]yyyy[-mm[-dd]]
(Gregorian calendar) or yyyy[-Www[-d]] (ISO week calendar), while the \fIclock\fP string must be of
the form hh:mm:ss[.xxx].  The use of delimeters and their type and positions must be as indicated
(however, input/output and plotting formats are flexible).
